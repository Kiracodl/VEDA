 has proven to be an invaluable tool that has enabled the imaging, measurement
 and manipulation of matter at the molecular and atomic scale.
 As the ability for AFM to measure and manipulate properties at the nanoscale
 has increased, so too has the importance of understanding the tip dynamics
 as the oscillating AFM probe interacts with nonlinear tip-sample interaction
 forces

 Ultimately the limits of dAFM nanometrology depend on the ability to correctly

 or eliminate such spurious effects in some manner.
 From an experimentalist's point of view, operating an dAFM can often be
 quite non-intuitive due to the underlying nonlinear dynamics.
 As a result the choice of operating conditions and cantilevers for a specific
 experiment can involve much trial and error.
 Where intuition fails, simulations can provide powerful insights into the
 fundamental physics of this instrument.
 With the aid of simulation tools like VEDA (Virtual Environment for Dynamic
 AFM), students and researchers can develop a deeper quantitative understanding
 of dAFM.

This document attempts to provide the user with the necessary information
 about the theory, modeling, and computational approach that are present

 AFM.

Dynamic Approach Curves

 simulates an AFM cantilever excited near resonance and brought towards
 a sample surface.
 Several different versions are available: Amplitude modulation (i.e.
 tapping mode) and Frequency modulation.
 The AM tool has both a basic and advanced version.
 The basic tool is suitable for simulating either ambient conditions or
 ultra high vacuum (UHV).
 The advanced tool is an expanded version of the basic tool allowing both
 multiple eigenmode simulations as well as multiple excitation frequencies.
 This tool is designed specifically for simulating approach/retraction curves
 in liquids, bimodal excitations, and internal resonance (harmonic cantilevers)
 applications.
 The model for cantilever dynamics includes a general number of eigenmodes
 and users are able to specify either acoustic (base) and magnetic excitation
 sources with single or multiple frequencies.
 The frequency modulated version simulates the situation where the AFM cantileve
r is excited at a frequency that is tuned to the nonlinear natural frequency
 through the use of a phase locked loop (PLL) and amplitude is maintained
 constant with an active feedback loop.

Basic concepts and terminology

 and reference frames.

Basic AFM design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A schematic of the standard AFM is shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 A microcantilever probe with a sharp tip (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:cant_sem"

\end_inset

) interacts with a sample.
 The position of the sample is controlled by a stage with piezo actuators.
 To create an image, the sample is moved so that the microcantilever probe
 tip rasters over the sample.
 The precise method by which an image of the sample's surface is generated
 from the raster depends on the imaging mode.
 However, in general, creating an image of the surface topography in AFM
 involves monitoring some characteristic measure (deflection, amplitude,
 phase, etc.) of the cantilever deflection caused by the interactions forces
 between the tip and the sample.
 Measurements of the microcantilever deflection have been made in a variety
 of ways.
 In the most common method, the optical-lever technique, a laser beam is
 reflected off of the cantilever and detected by a quadrature photodetector.
 For small deflections of the probe, signal of the photodetector is proportional
 to the change in slope (angle) of the microcantilever.

\begin_layout Subsection
Imaging modes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are myriad different AFM operating modes, all of which are built on
 the basic design above.
 These different modes have different strengths and weaknesses, and a particular
 task may be better served by one mode than another.
 A taxonomy of the major AFM modes is shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:imaging_modes"

\end_inset

.
 There is a major division between static modes and dynamic modes.
 In dynamic modes, the cantilever probe is excited (typically at resonance)
 as it is scanned over the surface.
 In static modes, the probe is not excited.
 Within static modes, two of the major modes are contact mode and force-volume
 mode.
 In contact mode, the probe is essentially in contact with the sample at
 all times.
 In force-volume mode and the related jump mode, the probe touches a point,
 retracts, moves to the next point, approaches, and touches the next point.
 Both of these modes are built upon force-distance curves, also known as
 F-Z Curves.
 In dynamic modes, two of the main modes are amplitude modulated (AM) and
 frequency modulated (FM).
 These names can be confusing because in both AM and FM modes a feedback
 controller is used to keep the vibration amplitude constant during a scan.
 In AM mode, the height of the probe above the sample is what is used to
 keep the vibration amplitude constant, while in FM mode, a more complicated
 feedback scheme is used that attempts to keep the oscillation amplitude,
 phase, and frequency shift constant while scanning the sample..
 These feedback schemes are described in more detail in Section

 Note that FM-AFM (Figure

b) is shown scanning far away from the sample to indicate operation in the
 attractive regime, and that AM-AFM (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:scanning"

\end_inset

c) is shown closer to the sample to indicate intermittent contact or repulsive
 regime.
 Although this is usually the way the two modes are used in practice, it
 is not the distinguishing characteristic.
 AM-AFM can be used in the attractive regime and FM-AFM can be used in the
 repulsive regime.
 The distinguishing characteristic between the two modes is the feedback
 scheme.

Excitation methods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With dynamic modes, there are many different methods by which the cantilever
 can be vibrated.
 Two of the most common are acoustic mode and magnetic mode.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:mag-v-aco"

\end_inset

 shows these two methods schematically.
 In the magnetic mode, a magnetic coating (or magnetic particles) is applied
 to the cantilever and a solenoid provides an alternating magnetic field
 that drives the cantilever.
 In acoustic mode, a so-called dither piezo vibrates up and down.
 which moves the base of the cantilever up and down.
 Note that due to the readout scheme used in most AFMs, the absolute deflection
 of the cantilever cannot be accessed but only the deflection relative to
 the base (bending).
 This can cause significant complications for acoustic mode in low Q (e.g.
 liquid) operation.
 More details on the difference between these excitations can be found in

In this section, we demonstrate why the photodiode is more sensitive to
 slope than displacement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:photodiode"

\end_inset

, we see that if a flat mirror is moved down, the laser spot will move on
 the photodiode.
 Similarly, if a flat mirror is rotated, the laser spot will move on the
 photodiode.
 Now for a cantilever, there will be some displacement at the end and some
 slope.
 There will be contributions from both.
 But which is more sensitive?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The static bending shape of a cantilever is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $g(x)=1-0.5{(x/L)}^{2}(3(x/L))$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 is cantilever length.
 This means that the slope 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{\prime}(L)=-1.5/L$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, for a bending displacement of 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

, the cantilever has a slope at the end of 
\begin_inset Formula $1.5h/L$
\end_inset

, which means the rotation angle is 
\begin_inset Formula $d\theta=\arcsin(1.5h/L)$
\end_inset

.
 Because the angles are small, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sin(d\theta)\approx d\theta$
\end_inset

.
 So, for bending displacement of 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

, the laser spot moves 
\begin_inset Formula $H*2*1.5h/L$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example assume H = 1 cm, 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

=45 deg, h=1e-9, L=100e-6 Then the displacement contribution to spot movement
 is 1.4e-9 = 1.4 nm and the rotation contribution is H*2*1.5h/L = 2e-7 = 200
 nm.
 In other words, the displacement contribution is less than 1 percent of
 the rotation contribution.
 For this reason, we typically ignore the displacement contribution.

At the backbone of dAFM is the assumption that the microcantilever's oscillation
s are affected by nonlinear interactions between the tip and sample.
 In particular, in AM-AFM, the amplitude of the microcantilever is affected
 by of both attractive and repulsive forces interactions between the tip
 and the sample.
 This occurs primarily because of the detuning on the nonlinear natural
 frequency from the fixed excitation frequency as the probe approaches the
 sample.
 However when the oscillation amplitude is much smaller than the decay length
 of the interaction forces, there is also a shift in linear frequency of
 the oscillator which can reduce the driven oscillation amplitude.
 Monitoring characteristics of the microcantilever's oscillation while approachi
ng a sample reveals information about the mechanical properties of the sample
 and of tip-sample interaction (imaging) forces.
 Additionally, an appropriate set-point amplitude for use in AM-AFM scanning
 (and simulated by the AMS tool) can be determined.
 The Amplitude Modulated Approach Curves (AMAC) tool can be utilized to
 simulate the response of a microcantilever excited near it's fundamental
 resonance and gradually introduced to the sample by extending the Z-piezo
 and reducing the 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 distance between the base and the sample.
 Input parameters for AMAC (basic) include the properties of the cantilever
 and the tip-sample interactions, as well as operating conditions and simulation
 parameters.

Example 1: Attractive and repulsive regimes of oscillation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this example, two different regimes of oscillation are explored.
 The attractive regime refers to oscillations where the interaction forces
 between the tip and sample are primarily attractive.
 Likewise, the repulsive regime refers to oscillations where the interactions
 with the sample are primarily repulsive contact forces.
 Proper identification of the attractive and repulse regimes is critical
 for an AFM experimentalist for improving imaging resolution, avoiding imaging
 bi-stabilities and correctly interpreting of phase contrast images.
 This first example is aimed at reproducing some of the key results from

Figure

 there is first a reduction in amplitude due to the attractive van der Waals
 interaction 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Garcia_PRB_1999"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 This reduction is due to the attractive interaction forces detuning the
 nonlinear resonance frequency of the probe tip from the fixed excitation
 frequency.
 This detuning also causes the phase of the first harmonic to increase above
 90 degrees, as shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 The onset of repulsive regime is marked by a jump in amplitude and correspondin

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While approaching the sample, the first harmonic phase first increases about
 90 degrees in the attractive regime of oscillations due to the softening
 of the nonlinear natural frequency.
 At this point, the nonlinear natural frequency has been detuned (decreased
 in this case) from the fixed excitation frequency applied to the probe.
 This results in a phase greater than 90 degrees.
 Continuing to approach the sample, a jump from the attractive to the repulsive
 regime occurs at a 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 distance around 27 nm.
 This jump is marked by a phase less than 90 degrees in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:DAC_Ex1_Phase"

\end_inset

.
 In the repulsive regime, the nonlinear natural frequency stiffens, and
 is now greater than the fixed excitation frequency applied to the probe.
 If the user repeats the simulations for an excitation frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{d}$
\end_inset

 not equal to the natural frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 (say 200 Hz above or below) the results will be slightly different because
 the detuning effects of the attractive and repulsive regimes will accomplish
 different results.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the cantilever proceeds through the attractive regime, there is eventually
 a sharp change in amplitude as the probes transitions from the attractive
 to the repulsive regime.
 By comparing the mean forces (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:DAC_Ex1_MF"

\end_inset

) to the amplitude (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:DAC_Ex1_AZ"

\end_inset

) and phase (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:DAC_Ex1_Phase"

\end_inset

), the user will find that the jumps in amplitude and phase occur precisely
 when the mean forces change abruptly from negative (attractive) to positive
 (repulsive).
 In this example, the change occurs around Z = 27 nm.
 Hence, the two regimes have been dubbed the attractive regime and the repulsive
 regime according to the mean interaction force observed during oscillation.

 This number is likely to be sufficient for most simulations.

 may wish to increase the value of the parameter.
 It is important to note that the tip-sample interactions are not directly

Example 2: Retraction curves
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this example, we investigate the tip dynamics during cantilever retraction
 from the surface.
 The cantilever/sample parameters used are the same in AMAC Example 1 (Section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Tools.DAC.Ex1"

\end_inset

).
 Retraction curves are particularly interesting when the approach curves
 show a discontinuous amplitude jump from attractive to repulsive regimes
 of oscillation.
 In fact it can be shown 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Garcia_PRB_1999"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 that there is a noticeable amplitude hysteresis between approach and retraction
 curves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We recommend completing AMAC Example 1 before proceeding to this example
 so the user can will be able to study the hysteresis due to the bi-stable
 oscillation regimes.
 The physical parameters, such as the cantilever properties and tip-sample
 interaction parameters, of this simulation are identical to the first example;
 however, we have changed the operating and simulation parameters to simulate
 retraction from the sample.
 The retraction is achieved by changing

 For this simulation we have simply inverted the default Z range.

Important note:
\emph default
 For these operating parameters there is a range of Z distances where there
 are two amplitude branches, hence the hysteresis.
 If the user is interested in studying approach/retraction hysteresis, the
 cantilever must start in the repulsive regime during retraction curves
 and the attractive regime during approach.
 In this simulation, the initial Z separation was chosen to be 0 assuring
 with a high degree of confidence that the cantilever will start in the
 repulsive regime.
 This is confirmed in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Had we chosen an initial Z separation closer to 25 nm, where there are
 two amplitude branches, this may not have been the case.

Example 3: Effects of viscoelastic damping in polymer samples
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our final example focuses on the effects of sample viscoelastic damping
 on the amplitude modulated approach curves and the resulting power dissipation
 curve resulting from this particular form of non-conservative tip-sample
 interaction.
 For this simulation, we choose sample properties that are characteristic
 of typical polymers including a sample viscosity of 500 Pa s (Table

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:DACex3_A_P"

\end_inset

, we see that the amplitude does not change very much with the addition
 of the viscoelastic forces, but the phase changes significantly.
 The change in phase can be related to the fact that viscoelastic forces
 are non-conservative.
 That is, they dissipate energy.
 This is seen in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:DACex3_Mf_Pf_Wdot"

\end_inset

.
 Additional effects of the viscous interaction are seen in the mean (Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:DACex3_Mf_Pf_Wdot"

\end_inset

a) and peak (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:DACex3_Mf_Pf_Wdot"

\end_inset

b) interaction forces.
 The viscoelasticity significantly raises the peak force, although the mean
 force decreases slightly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To have a better look at the forces, we can examine the interaction force
 time histories shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:DACex3_D_TS"

\end_inset

.
 During most of the cycle, the tip is not in contact with the sample.
 This figure shows just the small portion where they are in contact.
 Again, the peak value of the force is higher with the viscoelasticity,
 although the total area under the curve (the mean force) is approximately
 the same.
 Most notable, the shape of the force curve is asymmetric due to the viscous
 contribution.

city part of the theory section of this manual.

Amplitude Modulated Scanning (basic)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A microcantilever is commonly used to image nano-scale surfaces by tapping
 along the surface while monitoring the location of the cantilever base
 as well as the tip deflection amplitude.
 The Amplitude Modulated Scanning tool (AMS) was created to simulate the
 response of a microcantilever excited near its first flexural natural frequency
 and in contact with a sample while being moved along the surface of the
 sample as a controller attempts to keep the cantilever tip deflection amplitude
 constant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following assumptions are unique to the basic Amplitude Modulated Scanning
 tool: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Cantilever dynamics are modeled by a single eigenmode model (Eq.

\begin_inset Formula $i=1$

The cantilever is acoustically or magnetically excited with a single frequency.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$

 separation between the sample can be reduced or increased, but the cantilever
 does not move laterally.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

Inertial and hydrodynamic forces acting on the cantilever due to the controller'

Example 1: Silicon trench
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the first example, we choose to simulate an amplitude modulated AFM scan
 of a silicon trench, representing a critical feature of a semiconductor
 device.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Prior to performing the scanning simulation, we first explore the dynamics
 between the cantilever probe and the sample with the Amplitude Modulated
 Approach Curves tool.
 The necessary inputs for this simulation are all also present in Table
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:AMSEx"

\end_inset

 with the exception of the Z approach velocity, which was chosen as 200
 nm/s.
 To begin this example, open the 
\series bold

\series bold

 Enter the proper user inputs as shown in the Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, then click the 
\emph on

 button in the lower right-hand corner.
 After this simulation is complete, open the

 After the user input window has opened, change the input values to those

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the results of AMAC simulation (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:AMS_Ex1_dac_A_P"

\end_inset

), we find that the transition from attractive to repulsive regime is more
 subtle (See Example 1 (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Tools.DAC.Ex1"

\end_inset

) of AMAC for a contrasting example).
 To ensure that the cantilever will be tapping on the sample at the chosen
 set point ratio, we look at the phase vs.
 Z distance curve (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:AMS_Ex1_dac_A_P"

\end_inset

).
 When exciting the cantilever at resonance, a negative phase shift confirms
 that the cantilever is oscillating in the repulsive regime or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tapping
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 on the sample as long as the interaction is conservative.
 Finally, larger set point ratios are generally preferred to reduce peak
 repulsive interaction forces (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:AMS_Ex1_dac_Pf"

\end_inset

).
 With this in mind, we choose a set point ratio of 0.90 for this simulation.

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we need to determine the proportional gain and integral gain of the
 controller.
 To do so, we can apply the following methodology.
 The default gains should provide a good starting point, however these values
 may need to be adjusted for different cantilever and tip-sample properties
 and lock-in time constant.
 In general, if the system is unstable, or if there is a large ringing effect,
 these gains should be decreased.
 If the system is stable and there is no ringing, then these gains may be
 increased if there is a slow response time.
 Note that the controller is active during the transient computations so
 if the simulation progress bar stays on transient for a very long time,
 you may have an unstable controller and should probably decrease your gains.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Through some experimentation, we choose 0.002 as the proportional gain and
 0.002 as the integral gain.
 Finally, the sample geometry is constructed by choosing the trapezoidal
 feature type and entering a negative feature height.
 All other inputs for this example are shown in Table

 The measured topography (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:AMS_Ex1_H_P"

\end_inset

a) refers to the sample height imaged by the AFM.
 This is determined by first allowing the simulation to reach steady state
 oscillations at the specified set point ratio, and then as the cantilever
 begins to scan over the sample and the change in Z distance based on the
 lock-in (Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:cont"

\end_inset

) is recorded as the sample topography.
 The measurement error (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:AMS_Ex1_Merr_Aerr"

\end_inset

) represents the difference between the actual sample height and the measured
 topography.
 The amplitude error (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:AMS_Ex1_Merr_Aerr"

\end_inset

) represents the difference between the computed amplitude and the amplitude
 that satisfies the set point ratio.
 The amplitude is calculated two ways.
 First, by the lock-in and second by a Fourier transform.
 The controller uses the lock-in's calculation, the Fourier transform is
 provided as a reference so that you can check the performance of the lock-in.
 The phase (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:AMS_Ex1_H_P"

\end_inset

) is computed is the same manner.
 Finally, the mean and peak interaction forces (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:AMS_Ex1_Mf_Pf"

\end_inset

) and indentation (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

Example 2: Phase contrast in polymer blends
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this example we simulate scanning over a flat (no change in actual topography
), heterogeneous sample composed of two different polymers.
 The total sample is 30 nm long and there is a 10 nm patch in the center
 that has different visco-elastic properties than the rest.
 We choose a smooth sample (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:AMS_Ex2_H_P"

\end_inset

) to investigate the spurious topography imaged by the AFM due to different
 tip-sample interaction properties for the two materials.
 Finally, we choose similar input parameters as the previous example (Table
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:AMSEx"

\end_inset

), but with a cleaner signal (60 dB) to reduce measurement error due to
 signal noise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To run this simulation, choose 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Example 2
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 from the example loader drop down box.
 Looking at the material properties tab for the substrate versus the feature,
 we see that we are modeling the contact with a Hertz contact based model
 (sec 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Hertz-contact-based"

\end_inset

) and modeling the viscoelastic properties with a three element model (sec
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Three-element-model"

\end_inset

) The two modulii 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{2}$
\end_inset

 are the same, but the viscosity is different.
 A better understanding of what this means can be gained by using equations
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:Gstorage3elm"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:Gloss3elm"

\end_inset

 to calculate the storage and loss modulus for each material.
 This is shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "fig:AMS_ex2_dyn_mod"

\end_inset

.
 Because 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{2}$
\end_inset

 are the same, the static modulus (i.e.
 the modulus that would be probed by a slow F-z curve) are the same, as
 are the high frequency behaviors.
 However, because the viscosity is not the same, the dynamic behavior at
 intermediate frequencies is different.
 Specifically, near the drive frequency of 30 kHz (dashed line), the red
 curve (the feature in the center) is significantly 
\emph on
softer
\emph default
 than the blue curve (the substrate).
 The loss modulus is significantly higher on the blue material, so we expect
 more energy dissipation there.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results for this simulation are shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:AMS_Ex2_H_P"

\end_inset

-
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:AMS_Ex2_Mf_Pf_Wdot"

\end_inset

.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:AMS_Ex2_H_P"

\end_inset

 shows the topography imaged by the AFM.
 There is a step between the materials, but the sample is actually flat,
 so this is a measurement error of around -0.8 nm.
 Looking as the indentation (c) we see that there is also a 0.8 nm difference
 in indentation and we conclude that the measurement error is largely due
 to the difference in indentation of the (dynamically) softer sample.
 Thus topography errors can be expected due to changes in local viscoelasticity
 of the sample.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we were to repeat this simulation with a cantilever natural frequency
 that was significantly lower, there would be a reverse in phase contrast
 because there would be significantly more energy dissipation on the blue
 material than on the red.
 (try it yourself: for example 35 kHz nat.
 freq.
 and drive frequency.
 Also use a lockin time constant 2 kHz and 3.33 line/s).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is also clear phase contrast for the two different regions (d).
 In particular, the red material has a lower phase.
 This corresponds to less energy dissipation on the red material, as expected
 from the lower loss tangent at the driving frequency.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This simulation was relatively straighforward.
 Now let us repeat the simulation for a case that is not so easy to interpret.
 Increase the natural frequency and driving frequency to 200 kHz and increase
 the cantilever stiffness to 40 N/m.
 You may also want to increase the Scan lines per second to 36 so that the
 simulation runs in a similar amount of time.
 Repeat the simulation for both a setpoint of 0.9 and a setpoint of 0.3.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The result is shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:AMS_Ex2_higherfreq"

\end_inset

.
 We see that now, the red material has a 
\emph on
higher
\emph default
 phase at 90
\backslash
% setpoint, but a 
\emph on
lower
\emph default
 phase at 30% setpoint.
 How can this contrast reversal be explained? After all, the drive frequency
 is the same in both cases, and the red material has a lower loss tangent
 at the driving frequency.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To shed some light on the situation, we want to examine some time histories.
 If you've used the example loader, these were enabled.
 Otherwise, click to tab 3 Simulation Parameters, check the box ``Include

 This gives one time history when the tip is in the middle of the red region.
 We will want to compare the time histories for the different setpoints.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The time history of force is shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 Note that while the 
\emph on
cantilever deflection
\emph default
 is nearly sinusoidal, the time history of 
\emph on
force
\emph default
 is far from sinusoidal.
 In other words, if we examine the fourier transform of the force, it contains
 many higher harmonics (even though the fourier transform of the cantilever
 would have no significant higher harmonics).
 This means that the quantity of interest is not the loss tangent of the
 material at the driving frequency, but the loss tangent over a wide range
 of driving frequencies.
 Importantly, the number and relative magnitude of the higher harmonics
 is different for the two different setpoints, which means that effectively
 a different frequency range of the materials is being sampled in each case.

Example 3: Effects of adhesion, Jumps between regimes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the previous example, the topography error was largely attributed to
 a difference in indentation caused by a difference in sample elasticity.
 In this example we demonstrate that even for samples with identical elasticity,
 there can be topography errors that are not related indentation.
 This simulation consists of a hard substrate with a small step feature
 on it.
 The feature has identical tip-sample interaction properties to the substrate
 except that the Hamaker constant is slightly smaller.
 We also explore consequences of the attractive and repulsive regimes introduced
 in the Amplitude Modulated Approach Curves section.
 You may wish to work through AMAC example 1 and 2 before trying this example.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can run the example by choosing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Example 3
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 from the drop down menu, or by entering the parameters from the table manually.
 After the simulation runs look at the measured topography, Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:AMS_Ex3_topo1"

\end_inset

.
 You will note that the red line indicates the true topography and the blue
 line the measured topography.
 Clearly there is a significant error.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It will be instructive in sorting this out to consider what really is the
 effect on tip-sample interaction of changing the Hamaker constant while
 keeping the intermolecular distance the same? The Force Viewer tool can
 easily show this.
 This tool is explained in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Tools.ForceViewer"

\end_inset

.
 For now, we simply present the result in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:AMS_Ex3_Fts"

\end_inset

.
 We note that for the larger Hamaker constant, the minimum value of force
 is smaller, although it occurs at the same gap.
 Also, for a given force that is less than the minimum, say -1 nN, it occurs
 farther from the sample surface with a larger Hamaker constant.
 Since tapping mode images at a constant amplitude reduction, and to a rough
 approximation the same amplitude reduction will happen with a similar force
 level, we see that we might expect that with a larger Hamaker constant,
 the cantilever will be farther away from the same surface at the same amplitude
 reduction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, is there anything that we could do to get a better scan? Examine the
 mean interaction forces, shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:AMS_Ex3_mf1"

\end_inset

.
 Note that they are negative for the whole scan.
 That is, we are imaging in an attractive regime.
 We may guess that if we were to image in an repulsive regime, the effects
 of the attractive forces may be less important.
 The proper way to find the repulsive regime would be use the Amplitude
 Modulated Approach Curves tool (section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Tools.DAC"

\end_inset

).
 For now, assume that we'll try to guess a better set of parameters.
 Lower the setpoint ratio from 0.98 to 0.95 and re-run the simulation.
 The results should look like Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:AMS_Ex3_topo2"

\end_inset

.
 This is actually worse than before.
 Not only is the feature height incorrect, the section of substrate after
 the feature is incorrect as well.
 What is going on here? Again, examine the mean interaction forces for a
 clue, see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:AMS_Ex3_mf2"

\end_inset

.
 Note that the substrate section at the begining of the scan has an repulsive
 mean force while the substrate section at the end of the scan has an attractive
 mean force.
 We are now in a bi-stable region, which is even worse.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Again, the proper way to correct this situation is to perform Amplitude
 Modulated Approach Curves and find a good region for imaging.
 For now, try the following: raise the Unconstrained Amplitude from 13 nm
 to 25 nm.
 The results show now like look figures 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:AMS_Ex3_topo3"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:AMS_Ex3_mf3"

\end_inset

.
 The topography error is now much smaller on the step, and the mean interaction
 forces are repulsive for the whole scan.
 You'll note, of course, that now we have some overshoot at the leading
 edge of the step.
 This is due to poor controller gains.
 We briefly discussed controller gains in the next example.

\end_inset

In this section we explore the effects of controller gains on the scanning
 response.
 There are many factors which affect the response, the largest ones are
 scanning speed (slower speed = more accurate scan), setpoint ratio, lock-in
 time constants, and controller gains.
 In this example we will explore only the controller integral gains.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This example use the same basic parameters from Example 3 but the feature
 material properties to be the same as the substrate.
 To run this example, first select Example 4 from the Example loader drop
 down menu.
 The initial value of Integral gain will be 0.001.
 Run this simulation.
 Then click Input to go back, and enter an integral of 0.002.
 Repeat for 0.004 and 0.008.
 Then, examine the topography response (click the All button to overlay
 the results).
 If you zoom in, it should look similar to Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:AMS_Ex4"

\end_inset

, your lines may be different colors.
 The blue line in this example corresponds to a gain of 0.001.
 This gain is clearly a little low, it takes awhile for the controller to
 respond when it hits the step edge.
 The green line is 0.002.
 This is a little better.
 The purple line is 0.004.
 This response is much quicker, but now there is some overshoot.
 Finally, the orange line is 0.008.
 This gain is so high that the controller is on the verge of going unstable,
 and rings significantly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we take this example to the extreme, try entering an integral gain of
 0.032.
 You will note that the transient percent number fluctuates rapidly and
 does not converge.
 Eventually, it will give up without ever performing the simulation.
 This represents the fact that the controller cannot stabilize on the substrate
 surface and so it cannot even begin the scan (let alone the step edge).
 You will note that are some hints on stabilizing the controller in the
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ErrorMessage
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 drop down.
 Conversely, if we enter a value of 0.00001 for the integral gain, the controller
 will take so long to stabilize on the substrate surface that it will time
 out.

 In this example we demonstrate an imaging artifact that can occur on sticky
 (i.e.
 highly adhesive) samples.
 Choose example 5 from the Example loader.
 Note that this simulation models the substrate with Hertz contact (no adhesion)
 and the feature with DMT contact (adhesion).
 When you run the simulation, the measured topography should look like Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:AMS_Ex5_1"

\end_inset

.
 On the feature (between X=25 and X=75), there is a series of sharp spikes.
 The cantilever appears to be jumping away from the surface for some reason.
 This is apparently some kind of controller instability.
 Based on the results in the previous example, we might try to decrease
 the controller gains.
 However that will not change the behavior (try it for yourself).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The best way to determine what is going on is to open the Dynamic Approach
 Curves tool and examine the approach curve for the cantilever and sample
 parameters.
 In particular, we should examine the behavior around 70% setpoint ratio
 that we are using in this example.
 Perform one run for the substrate (Hertz contact) and one for the sample
 (DMT).
 The result should look like 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:AMS_Ex5_2"

\end_inset

.
 On the substrate (red curve) the amplitude is reduced smoothly to zero
 as the cantilever approaches the surface.
 But on the sample, the cantilever snaps in to permanent contact with the
 surface at about A=4.5 nm (75% setpoint).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can now explain the scanning behavior.
 The cantilever starts far from the surface with a large amplitude.
 The controller brings the cantilever closer to the surface to reduce the
 amplitude.
 However, before the amplitude is reduced to the setpoint of 70%, the cantilever
 snaps-in and the amplitude jumps to nearly 0.
 The controller sees that this amplitude reduction has gone too far, and
 pulls the cantilever away from the sample in order to increase the amplitude.
 The process then repeats.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There simply is no settings of controller gains or scannin speeds that would
 make this system stable.
 In a real experiment, the only two choice would be to raise the setpoint
 ratio to a point that is stable (e.g.
 80%), or to change the free amplitude.
 Raising the setpoint is simple enough, but the behavior on change the free
 amplitude may be non-intuitive.
 Try raising the unconstrained amplitude to 7 nm, and then decreasing it
 to 5 nm.
 Which one gives a larger stable region (in terms of amplitude ratio)?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You should find that raising the free amplitude decreases the width of the
 stable region (i.e.
 the jump happens at 80% instead of 75) but lowering the free amplitude
 increases the width of the stable region (i.e.
 the jump happens at 70% instead of 75).
 Why should this be? The answer has to do with the stability of dynamic
 systems, and is somewhat out of the scope of this manual.
 The curious reader is encouraged to find an introductory text on mechanical
 vibrations.

 At this amplitude ratio, single impact oscillations are observed where
 the tip makes contact with the sample once per oscillation period.

Looking at the phase of the response (Figure

 and Figure

Figure

 demonstrates that tip-sample contact time for soft cantilevers in liquids
 behaves much differently than stiff cantilevers in air (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:DACex2_C"

\end_inset

).
 Inside a given impact regime, contact time is actually decreasing as amplitude
 ratio decreases.
 This is happens because of the role momentary excitation of the second
 eigenmode during tip-sample contact.
 Secondly, we see that contact time increases nearly stepwise near the beginning
 of a multiple impact regime, also indicating the importance of second eigenmode
 dynamics to tip-sample contact for soft cantilevers in liquids.

 Near times of contact with the sample, the second eigenmode becomes momentary

 (a) and (b), respectively, for lock-in time constants of 500 us and 5 ms.
 Only after increasing the lock-in time constant by an order of magnitude
 does the amplitude of the second eigenmode converge.
 The reason for this becomes clear looking at the time history in Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
 The second eigenmode interacts sporadically with the sample due to the
 combination of external forcing excitation and the momentary excitation
 from the tip-sample interaction.
 This leads to mixture of single and double impact oscillations occurring
 at the same amplitude ratio.

 Internal resonance is a phenomenon that occurs for special cantilevers

 first torsion mode, is very near an integer multiple of the fundamental
 eigenmode

\begin_layout Standard
The second eigenmode is excited by a harmonic of the tip-sample interaction
 force and therefore contains information about tip-sample interaction and
 thus the material properties of the sample.
 Unlike phase contrast in air (See Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:ADACex3_DTS_E_s2"

\end_inset

), which tells only about variations in dissipative (nonconservative) interactio
ns, the amplitude of the second eigenmode in an internal resonance scheme
 contains information about conservative interactions.
 For the two purely elastic samples (conservative tip-sample forces), there
 is a clear contrast in the amplitude of the second 7th harmonic due to
 the different elasticities.

 We will attempt to show that bimodal AFM is sensitive to variations in
 conservative attractive forces.
 Select example 5 from the dropdown example loader and run the simulation.
 Then click back to tab 2 and change the Hamaker constant from 4e-20 to
 9e-20, and run the simulation.
 Compare the two different results.
 In particular look at the 1st and 2nd frequency phase.
 Note that we are plotting these phases against the 1st frequency amplitude
 ratio.
 Then, click back to tab 3, and change the x-axis variable to

 Simulate both Hamaker constants.
 Examine the two phases now.
 Your results should look like Figure

.
 You should find contrast between the two materials when plotting the cross-mode
 representation.
 That is, when you plot 2nd phase against 1st amplitude, or 1st phase against
 2nd amplitude, there is contrast between the two material.
 But when you plot 1st phase versus 1st amplitude, or 2nd phase versus 2nd
 amplitude, the two materials look identical.
 Your simulation results will likely show a little more noise than

 This is because we have picked a fast approach speed (100 nm/s) in order
 to keep the simulation time short.
 Reducing the approach speed will yield cleaner results.

Material Contrast in Bimodal AFM

While imaging a two component-blend polymer sample with a tapping mode cantileve
r in air, what types of material contrast can bimodal AFM give between the
 two blends? Open the Amplitude Modulated Scanning tool (advanced) and Load
 Example 1.
 This will set the parameters for a small step feature on a substrate, initially
 the feature and the substrate have the same material properties.

 By default, the feature has the same material properties as the substrate.
 Now, click back and change the Feature Young's modulus to 5 GPa on tab
 4.
 Run this simulation.
 Examine the 1st harmonic phase.
 Can you see any difference between the phase on the feature and on the
 substrate?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You should notice two things.
 First, there is a topography error due to the different stiffness of the
 feature.
 Second, there is no phase contrast.
 Remember, phase in tapping mode depends on the RATIO of dissipative to
 conservative forces.
 That ratio is zero for both cases here because there is no dissipative
 component.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, change back to tab 1, and select Bimodal.
 You'll note that the drive amplitudes and frequencies are already filled

 Run this simulation.
 Examine second frequency amplitude and phase.
 You should see a very clear contrast between the materials.

Amplitude Modulated Approach curves, steady state solution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
THIS SECTION IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The basic idea of the tool is described in Ref 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "rajabifar2018dynamic"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This tool uses a completely different method than all of the other tools.
 Instead of numerically solving the exact equations in time, an single-harmonic
 steady state version is used.
 This is less accurate, however in many situations can still provide a reasonabl
e estimate and is an order of magnitude faster than other tools.
 This was motivated by the desire to simulate polymer surfaces using Attard's
 model (section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:attard"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 This model is computationally intractable for the direct simulation used
 in the other tools, but runs in a reasonable amount of time with this tool.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The basic options are similar to the other Amplitude Modulated Approach
 Curves tools.
 Some exceptions are described below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, the excitation frequency is always assumed to be equal to the natural
 frequency (i.e.
 on resonance operation).
 Second, for bimodal operation, the tool needs to compute a number of cycles
 equal to the lowest common multiple (aka as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

winding number
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) of the two drive periods.
 E.g.
 if the second frequency is 6.5 times the first, then the winding number
 is 2 (i.e.
 the pattern repeats every 2 cycles of the first frequency and every 13
 cycles of the second frequency, because 13/2=6.5).
 If the ratio is 6.25 then the winding number is 4, and if the ratio is 6.249,
 then the winding number is 1000 (6249/1000 = 6.249).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To avoid this number being excessive, the second drive frequency is rounded.
 Two types of rounding are available.
 The first is ordinary everyday rounding to either 1, 2 or 3 decimal places.
 For example 6.24 (156/25, winding number 25) could be rounded to 6.2 (31/5
 winding number 5).
 Although this is easy to understand, it may result in a larger than necessary
 winding number (i.e.
 a slower simulation).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A more intelligent rounding is available.
 This looks for a pair integers p, q such that p/q is approximately equal
 to the desired ratio and q is no more than a specified limit.
 q is the winding number.
 E.g.
 instead of rounding 6.24 down to 6.2 (winding number 5) with ordinary rounding,
 we could round it up to 6.25, which has a winding number of 4.
 This results in a simulation that is 20% faster.

Example 1: This is an identical set of parameters to Example 1 from the
 Basic Amplitude Modulated Approach Curves tool, meant to illustrate the
 differences between them.
 You should note that the steady state tool runs an order of magnitude faster,
 and gets nearly the same result.
 However, as the amplitude reduction must always be monotonic in this tool,
 it misses a portion of the curve after the jump from attractive to repulsive
 mode.

Frequency Sweep
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the process of imaging a sample, an AFM operator would typically use
 a frequency sweep tuning curve to find a natural frequency (in order to
 pick an operating frequency), and possibly to measure the quality factor
 and/or stiffness of the given cantilever.
 In this case, the frequency sweep performed far from the sample, and frequency
 response is linear.
 To study nonlinear interactions with the sample, the cantilever is brought
 closer to the sample so that the oscillating tip interacts with the sample.
 The frequency sweep tool in VEDA is able to simulate frequency sweeps while
 in interacting with the sample.
 This is useful for gaining understanding of the underlying nonlinear dynamics
 of AFM as well as understanding the operation of the instrument.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:SweepEx1_1"

\end_inset

.
 This figure is approximately the same as Fig 9 in Lee, et al., with three
 exceptions.
 First, Lee, et al.
 plotted peak-peak amplitudes while VEDA plots peak amplitudes, so the results
 are different by a factor of two.
 Second, Lee, et al.
 did not use exactly 0.1 nm steps.
 Finally, the paper was computed using AUTO97, which is able to find unstable
 branches (the dashed lines in Figure 9 of Lee, et al.
 ).
 VEDA integrates the differential equation numerically and so only the stable
 branches can be plotted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We note the following results about the plot.
 The lowest curve, representing 89.3 nm amplitude, is approximately the frequency
 response of a linear single degree of freedom (DOF) oscillator.
 The separation 90 nm minus the peak amplitude 89.3 nm yields a minimum tip-sampl
e separation of 0.7 nm during the oscillation.
 At this range the van der Waals forces are almost zero, so there is little
 non-linear effect.
 With each successive curve, the minimum tip-sample separation decreases,
 so now van der Waals forces start to be significant.
 On each curve, identify the point at which the maximum amplitude occurs.
 You will notice that these points are decreasing in frequency as amplitude
 increases.
 This is characteristic of a 
\emph on
softening
\emph default
 non-linearity (see, for example 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "JordanSmith"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 At 89.8 nm unconstrained amplitude, the resonant peak will start to move
 up in frequency.
 This indicates that the repulsive DMT forces are starting to have some
 effect.
 DMT contact forces have a 
\emph on
stiffening
\emph default
 effect.
 By 90.0 nm unconstrained amplitude, the resonance peak has moved to the
 right of the original resonant peak.
 If we draw a line connecting the resonance peaks for each curve, we get
 the

 At 89.8 nm the mean force is still attractive but it is has started to turn
 around and come back towards zero.
 At 90.0 you see that the mean force has become positive (repulsive) for
 the first time.
 This is the transition between the so-called 
\series bold
attractive
\series default
 and 
\series bold
repulsive
\series default
 imaging regimes.

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, in an real experiment we could not observe tip-sample interaction
 force directly.
 But we can observe the phase of the response signal.
 Choose

 from the drop down box, which will look like Figure

.
 For the curves in the attractive regime, note that the phase angle increases
 (relative to the linear case) as the frequency sweeps through resonance
 but for the curves in the repulsive regime, the phase angle decreases.

Example 2: Effect of sample Stiffness on non-linear response
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this example, we will determine the effect of sample stiffness on the
 non-linear frequency response that we found in the previous example.
 This example will use the same basic parameter set as Example 1.
 If you have just run example 1, then hit the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Clear
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 button in the outputs window to delete the old results and then go back
 to the Simulation.
 If you are starting this example fresh, follow the instructions to in Example
 1 to input the first set of parameters, or use the Example Loader to get
 the first set of parameters.
 Make sure the Unconstrained Amplitude is 90.2 nm.
 Then in the simulation tab, change the Young's modulus to 5 GPa and hit
 the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

simulate
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 button.
 Once the simulation has run, return the to inputs window and change Young's
 modulus to 10 GPa.
 Repeat for 15, 20, and 25 GPa.

 If you zoom in a little bit, the output window should look like Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 You will notice that the jump-down happens farther to the right for stiffer
 samples.
 That is, there is a larger range of frequencies where non-linear effects
 are important.
 This is a general trend in AFM: Tip-sample non-linearities are more pronounced
 for stiffer samples.

Example 3: Sweep up versus sweep down
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this example, we will examine the difference between sweep up (starting
 at a low frequency and gradually increasing the frequency) and sweep down
 (starting at a high frequency and gradually decreasing the frequency).
 For a linear system, these two are always identical, but for a non-linear
 system they may be quite different.
 This example will use the same basic parameter set as Examples 1 and 2.
 If you have just run example 1 or 2, then hit the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Clear
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 button in the outputs window to delete the old results and then go back
 to the Simulation.
 If you are starting this example fresh, follow the instructions to in Example
 1 to input the first set of parameters, or use the Example Loader to get
 the first set of parameters.
 Make sure the Unconstrained Amplitude is 90.2 nm, and set the sample Young's
 modulus to 15 GPa and hit the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

simulate
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 button.
 Once the simulation has run, return the to inputs window and reverse fd
 start and fd stop (i.e.
 set fd start = 44.5 and set fd stop = 43.5 kHz).
 Then hit simulate again.

You will notice that the sweep up and sweep down are close to each other,
 except for a small region in the middle.
 If you zoom in on this region, the output window should look like Figure

\end_inset

.
 First, examine the responses at 44.2 kHz.
 At this frequency, the sweep up and sweep down simulations have very different
 amplitudes.
 This mean that at this particular combination of Z, unconstrained amplitude,
 and drive frequency, there are two different possible solutions.
 Which solution you get depends on the initial conditions (i.e.
 where you are coming from).
 Note that this condition, refered to as bi-stability, can be undesirable
 for imaging.
 Bi-stabilities are explored more in the Amplitude Modulated Approach Curves
 examples.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, examine the response at 44.3 kHz.
 There is also a small difference between sweep up and sweep down here.
 Is this also due to a non-linear effect? No.
 This is a linear effect due to the fact that we are changing frequency
 at a fairly rapid rate (change of 1 kHz in 0.1s) so that the system is not
 quite at steady state.
 If you were to repeat this simulation but with a sweep time of 0.5s instead,
 there should be much better agreement at 44.3 kHz, but of course that simulation
 will take five times longer to run.
 You might also notice that the jump-downs will be sharper (higher slope)
 at the slow sweep rate, and might happen at slightly different frequencies.

\begin_layout Standard
This tool simulates approach and retraction curves between the tip of an
 unexcited cantilever and a sample.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following assumptions are unique to the F-Z Curves tool: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The cantilever is unexcited (forcing function applied to the cantilever).
 Any tip deflections would be caused by interactions between the tip and
 sample only.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Interactions between the tip and the sample are modeled by any one of the
 models described in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 separation between the sample can be reduced or increased, but the cantilever
 does not move laterally.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Inertial forces caused by the 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 motion are negligible (but viscous forces are included)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The curves may be triggered (approach to a specific deflection and then
 reverse) or untriggered (approach to a specific Z distance and then reverse).

Example 1: Approaching and retracting from a sample modeled using DMT contact
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary experimental observable in this type of experiment is tip deflection
 versus Z displacement, and this is shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:FZex1_deflZ"

\end_inset

.
 Typically this deflection is then multiplied by the cantilever static bending
 stiffness to arrive at tip-sample interaction force versus Z displacement.
 Since this is a simulation, we have the tip-sample force available to us
 directly, see figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:FZex1_FtsZ"

.
 Note that there appears to be some ringing of the cantilever on snap-in.
 This is because VEDA is simulating the entire cantilever dynamics in the
 time-domain, it is not a static solution.
 Two quantities that are often of interest in force spectroscopy are tip-sample
 interaction force versus gap and indentation versus Z displacement.
 In an experiment these would have to be reconstructed from the observed
 deflection, but since this is a simulation, we have them directly in Figures

Example 2: Approaching and retracting from a sample modeled using JKR
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This example uses the exact same parameters as Example 1, except the sample
 is modeled using JKR contact instead of DMT.
 Assuming you have already run example 1, go back to tab 2, change the interacti
on model to JKR and then simulate again.
 Compare the results for the two different interaction models.
 When you examine the cantilever deflection versus Z (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:JKRex2_FtsZ"

\end_inset

) you will note that during the approach, the cantilever tip snaps onto
 the sample later using the JKR model than with the DMT contact model.
 The reason for this is the discontinuous jump in the force seen in JKR,
 whereas the DMT contact model utilized an attractive van der Waals force
 even before the cantilever tip contacts the sample.

Force Viewer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to run a simulation, it is necessary to specify a tip-sample interactio
n model.
 Cartoons of representative tip-sample interaction models are given in section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:fts"

\end_inset

.
 It is often useful, however, to see the exact tip-sample force vs.
 gap curve for a specific set of parameters.
 The F-Z curves tool can be used for this (e.g.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:FZex1_FtsD"

\end_inset

), however the problem with that tool is that since it simulates the cantilever
 dynamics, some regions of the F-d curve are not visible.
 That is, when the cantilever snaps-in or pulls-off, it skips over a region
 in the F-d curve.
 The force-viewer tool is utility that does not have this deficiency.
 It plots the entire F-d curve independent of any cantilever dynamics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Example 1: DMT Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As an example, we shall plot the tip-sample interaction force for the parameter
 of F-Z curves Example 1.
 Open the Force Viewer tool from the VEDA tools menu.
 Enter 5 nm for the starting gap, -0.9 for the final gap.
 On the Tip-sample interaction tab, enter the parameters from Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:FZcurvesEx"

\end_inset

 Example 1.
 Press simulate.
 You should get an output like Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:FViewEx1_FtsD"

\end_inset

.
 Compare this with Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:FZex1_FtsD"

\end_inset

.
 The two figures should be identical, except Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:FViewEx1_FtsD"

\end_inset

 contains the entire curve in the area where Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:FZex1_FtsD"

\end_inset

 had a blank spot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The force viewer also plots the interaction stiffness, which is the first
 derivative of the interaction force.
 This is useful for comparision to many small-amplitude spectroscopy theories
 which calculate interaction stiffness (e.g.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "debeer2010dissipation"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 Note that the sign convention on interaction stiffness is typically taken
 such that a positive interaction stiffness causes a positive shift in resonance
 frequency.
 In other words, 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{int}=-\frac{\partial}{\partial d}F_{ts}(d)$
\end_inset

.
 Versions of VEDA prior to 2.0.19 (Feb 2011) used the opposite sign convention
 (positive gradient causes negative frequency shift, which is not as commonly
 used in the literature).

The force viewer tool can also be used to explore non-conservative forces.
 In this case, the forces when approaching the sample are different than
 the forces retracting from the sample.
 In this example, we demonstrate using the tip-sample force viewer to see
 the forces when a Prony series model is used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We start with the DMA (Dynamic Mechanical Analysis) data of Read 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 for polypropylene.
 The raw data is reproduced in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Read_polymer"

\end_inset

.
 This data is specified as 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{loss}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{storage}$
\end_inset

 versus frequency, which is typical for DMA data.
 VEDA cannot directly utilize this type of data.
 Instead, we must fit the data to one of the constitutive models in section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:fts"

\end_inset

.
 In this case we use a Prony series (Generalized Maxwell) section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Prony"

\end_inset

.
 The Prony series consists of a set of pairs of modulii 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{j}$
\end_inset

 and relaxation times 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 To do the fit, we specify the 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{j}$
\end_inset

 a priori, and then use a least squares fit to calculate the modulii 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{j}$
\end_inset

 that best fit the data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this case we choose to use a seven term series (more terms will fit the
 data better, but obviously will take longer to simulate).
 We anticipate running a simulation with a 100 kHz cantilever which will
 have a contact time of a few microseconds, so we choose the relaxation
 times equally spaced (on a logarhythmic scale) between 2 ms and 0.1 us,
 which gives relaxation time spaced above and below the expected contact
 time.
 The fit is conducted using lsqcurvefit() command in Matlab.
 You can use the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 tool to do these fits on your own data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results are shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Read_polymer_fit"

\end_inset

.
 As you can tell, the Prony series fits the data reasonable well between
 100 Hz and 1 MHz.
 A better fit could have been obtained with more terms, but this is not
 bad for an example.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now we will see the forces that result from indenting this sample.
 Open the force viewer tool and select Example 2 from the drop down box.
 You'll note that the Non-conservative velocity option has been set to a
 sine wave with duration 10 microseconds, and that the initial gap is set
 just above zero.
 This approximately simulates a contact time of 10 us.
 On the tip-sample interaction tab, you'll note that the Prony series coefficien
ts have been filled in at the bottom under Non-conservative forces.
 Click to simulate a single tap with these parameters.
 Then, go back to tab 1 and decrease the time from 10 microseconds to 0.1
 microsecond and re-run.

 The tip-sample interaction parameters are identical.
 For the FZ curves tool, the Z distance is specified, and the tip-sample
 gap is determined based on the dynamic deflection of the cantilever.
 In the force viewer tool, the tip-sample gap is specified a priori.
 There is no cantilever.
 In the limit of an extremely stiff cantilever (i.e.
 zero cantilever deflection) the two tools would give the same result.

 We have implemented the method of

 to automatically calculate gains for the PLL and amplitude controller.
 Leave this box checked to get a good starting guess for the gains.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The simulation parameters tab contains one difference from the AM tools.
 For the AM tools, it was possible to plot most variables against either
 Z displacement or setpoint ratio.
 For FM, setpoint ratio does not exist because amplitude is constant.
 Therefore, the options are Z displacement and min gap (also known as the
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

distance of minimum approach
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the literature).
 Choose min gap for this simulation to compare with Nony's results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hit the simulate button and wait for the simulation to run.
 Note that this simulation does take several minutes to run.
 If you are short on time, you can increase the approach speed to 20 nm/s.
 The results will be slightly off, but the general picture will be okay.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first thing you should check in any frequency modulation approach curve
 is the the controller performance.
 Examine the first harmonic amplitude and first harmonic phase.
 You will want to verify that the these two parameters stay relatively constant
 during the approach.
 The phase is shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:FMAC_Ex1_Phase"

\end_inset

.
 In this case phase is constant to within about 0.1 degree during the majority
 of the approach and starts to deviate at the very end (where the Morse
 potential starts changing very rapidly).
 The amplitude controller also performs well, about 0.1 percent deviation
 over the entire range.
 This controller performance should be acceptable.
 When you start to run your own simulations, always check these two parameters.
 If the first harmonic amplitude or phase starts to deviate from a straight
 line, you'll need to tune the controller parameters.
 If these drop significantly, you may need to increase the gains.
 If they start a growing oscillation, you may need to decrease the gains.
 You will need to reconsider the gains any time you change a parameter,
 but especially approach speed, quality factor, lock-in parameters, sampling
 rate, and natural frequencies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, examine the FM Feedback results.
 This contains the two main FM observables.
 The frequency shift is of most interest.
 The shape of the frequency shift follows the tip-sample interaction force.
 In fact, the exact tip-sample interaction force should be recoverable from
 the frequency shift (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Sader_APL_2004"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 The other channel is the drive amplitude, which is sometimes called the
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

apparent dissipation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or sometimes just 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

dissipation.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 In this case, the Morse potential is a purely conservative interaction,
 so there is no actual dissipation there.
 However, the driving frequency is changing, and the energy dissipation
 of a simple harmonic oscillator changes with the drive frequency.
 This is one contribution to the apprent dissipation.
 A second component is the small phase error we noted before.
 A phase error indicates that the PLL is not exactly tracking the natural
 frequency, and when driving off resonance more energy is required.
 To reduce this error, we could decrease the approach speed to give the
 PLL more time to react.

FM Scanning
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The FM scanning tool combines the functionality of the other scanning tools
 with the frequency modulation discussed under FM Approach Curves.
 The only additions are that there is now a frequency shift setpoint on
 tab 2 (you can specify if this should be an attractive or repulsive shift).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is recommended to use autocalculation of the Amplitude and PLL gains
 when using this tool.
 If you wish to use non-default gains, it is suggested that you use the
 FM Approach curves tool to find stable gains first, then move on to this
 tool.
 Otherwise if you have stability problems, it will be difficult to determine
 if the problem is with your Z (topography) gains or with the FM gains.

 Select example 1 from the drop down menu.
 On the tip-sample interaction properties tab, note that we have picked
 a 5 nm tip radius.
 The end of the tip is assumed to be spherical.
 Also, on the feature properties tab, we've picked a sinusoidal feature
 with height 30 nm and width 35 nm and checked the box for tip-sample convolutio
n.

 The measured topography (blue) resembles the actual sample geometry (red),
 but it is just slightly wider.
 This is a common problem with measuring widths of small features.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Go back to the feature properties tab and reduce the feature width to 25

 Repeat the simulation for feature widths of 15, 5, and 1 nm.

 Note that as the feature width decreases, the measured geometry looks less
 and less like a sinusoid, and more like a rectangle a circle of radius
 5 nm on top (draw in dashed line for illustration).
 In this case, the sample is showing us an image of the tip, instead of
 the tip showing us an image of the sample!

Peak force tapping tool
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
THIS SECTION IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The peak force tapping tool simulates the scanning mode of the same name
 (https://www.bruker.com/content/bruker/int/en/products-and-solutions/microscopes/
materials-afm/afm-modes/peakforce-tapping.html).
 In this mode, the Z piezo is oscillated at a frequency considerably lower
 than the cantilever resonance, e.g.
 2 kHz for a 100 kHz cantilever.
 Effectively this collects a series of force-distance curves.
 For each curve, the deflection is processed to extract the peak force,
 and then a feedback control is used to adjust the mean Z position such
 that the peak force is constant over the scan.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Major assumptions of this tool:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In a real AFM, only the deflection is an experimental observable and the
 force must be reconstructed.
 This is illustrated in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:peakforcetappingassumption"

\end_inset

.
 In the quasi-static limit (excitation << resonance frequency), the cantilever
 behaves as a simple spring F=kx and force is simply deflection times stiffness.
 For finite excitation frequencies, there will be some steady state dynamic
 response, but it is fairly easy to filter it out and recover the tip-sample
 force.
 As the excitation frequency becomes higher, this reconstruction becomes
 more difficult.
 The feedback control in the VEDA peak force tapping tool is directly on
 the simulated tip-sample force.
 In other words, it is assumed that the force can be 
\emph on
perfectly
\emph default
 reconstructed from the observed deflection.
 This will be true only for very low excitation frequencies.

Example 2: Flat sample with two different materials, using Attard's model

This example is similar to the Amplitude Modulated Scanning (basic) Example

, in that a flat sample is modeled with two different materials.
 Whereas that example used a Hertz based viscoelastic contact model, in
 this example we demonstrate the use of Attard's viscoelastic contact model
 (section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As Attard's model is more computationally demanding, the scan lines per
 second has been increased to 10 for this example versus the previous one
 to keep the run time reasonable.
 This can be decreased if you want to more realistically simulate a higher
 resolution scan.

 model, followed by models for cantilever dynamics, controller dynamics,
 the DDASKR numerical integration scheme, and tip-sample geometry convolution.

Models for tip-sample interaction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
VEDA currently offers several options for models for interaction forces
 between the tip and the sample, including piecewise linear contact, Hertz
 contact, Derjaguin-Müller-Toporov (DMT), Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek
 (DLVO) electrostatic double layer forces, Chadwick model for thin membranes
 and Kelvin-Voigt dissipation.
 With the exception of the ad-hoc linear contact model, interaction models
 are based on a spherical tip interacting with an elastic medium.
 The contact mechanics for these models is strictly valid for a spherical
 tip interacting with a flat, isotropic, linearly elastic sample surface
 and will continue to hold so long as the features of the sample are sufficientl
y larger than the tip radius.
 However, when interacting with nanostructures that are of the similar size
 as the tip, the contact mechanics model is not adequate.

Piecewise linear contact
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The piecewise linear contact model, the simplest of the models described
 here, is an ad-hoc model which is often applied to small indentations of
 small shell-like structures such as viral capsids, hollow microtubules
 or carbon nanotubes.
 This model will be applicable when Van der Waals or electrostatic forces
 are negligible (e.g.
 in high ionic concentration buffer solutions).
 This model is useful for simple simulations and to compare sample stiffness
 directly to cantilever stiffness.
 For a contact stiffness (force gradient) 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{ts}^{rep}$

 and tip-sample gap 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Technically, this model is actually not for a spherical tip, but for a paraboloi

 The paraboloid is a good approximation to a sphere when the tip radius

\begin_inset Formula $a_{crit}=(\pi Rtip^{2}W_{JKR}/8E^{*})^{1/3}$

 While approaching in noncontact (m=0), contact occurs at 
\begin_inset Formula $d=0$

 Upon retraction from the sample, tip-sample contact persists until 
\begin_inset Formula $d>d_{crit}>0$

 At this point, the tip and sample separate and there is an abrupt transition
 from contact to noncontact.
 Note that the representation of the JKR model in Eq.

 from the sample.
 This dependence on the history of the gap between the tip and sample makes
 the mode variable necessary to describe this model.

\end_inset

 goes from 0 to 1) at 
\begin_inset Formula $d=0$
\end_inset

, and the chain break (
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 from 1 to 0) at at pre-specified distance 
\begin_inset Formula $d=L_{r}$
\end_inset

.
 The distance 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{r}$
\end_inset

 can be choosen such that the bond ruptures at a particular force.
 This transition behavior is an approximation for ease of computation.
 In reality the bond rupture will be controlled by a stochastic process
 where there is a certain probability of the bond breaking at a given force
 level.
 This is a reasonable approximation because for many applications, the tip
 sample forces stay well below the bond rupture force (i.e.
 the chain never breaks).

 without bound.
 Further, using the Derjaguin approximation

 regardless of the tip shape.
 Therefore, versions of VEDA starting from 2.0.27 use the following for the
 hydration force:

) had the viscosity decay smoothly to zero as the tip indents the sample.
 However, that was somewhat ad-hoc.
 The present assumption that the viscosity saturates to a constant value
 at contact is more physically justifiable.
 The assumption that even when the tip and sample are in contact, there
 is still a region just outside the contact area where liquid molecules
 are being squeezed.
 It is similar to the assumption in the DMT model that attractive forces
 saturate when the tip and sample contact.
 The difference between the previous model and the present model is trivially
 small for stiff samples.
 This is because the indentations are typically small on stiff samples,
 and the velocities are small when the tip and sample are in contact.

Surface Energy Hysteresis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Surface energy hysteresis is a catch-all term for a large number of physical
 processes that cause the energy of forming a solid-solid interface to be
 greater that the energy of destroying the interface.
 For these processes, the total energy dissipation will depend only on the
 total contact area formed, not on the tip velocity.
 Ref.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Garcia2006"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 suggests a tip sample interaction model including surface energy hysteresis.
 The model was based on a DMT model.
 In the original formulation, the attractive and repulsive parts are handled
 separately (the attractive part was called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

long-range dissipative interfacial interactions
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 Using a slightly different notation, they can be combined into one expression
 as follows
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
F_{ts,app}(d)=\begin{cases}
-\frac{HR}{d^{2}} & d>a_{0}\\
\frac{4}{3}E^{*}\sqrt{R}(a_{0}-d)^{3/2}-\frac{HR}{a_{0}^{2}}, & d<a_{0}
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard

-\frac{(H+4\pi\gamma a_{0}^{2})R}{d^{2}} & d>a_{0}\\
\frac{4}{3}E^{*}\sqrt{R}(a_{0}-d)^{3/2}-\frac{HR}{a_{0}^{2}}-4\pi R\gamma, & d<a_{0}
\end{cases}
\]

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
F_{ts}(d,\dot{d})=\begin{cases}
F_{ts,app}(d), & \dot{d}<0\\
F_{ts,ret}(d), & \dot{d}>0
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

We note that this model includes only a single parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

, which is the change in surface energy (J/m
\begin_inset script superscript

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

) between approach and retract , to describe the strength of the hysteresis.
 Ref.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 had two parameters, one for 
\begin_inset Formula $d<a_{0}$
\end_inset

 and a separate one for 
\begin_inset Formula $d>a_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 Although that is a more general case than our model, it means that the
 force described by that model is not necessarily continuous at 
\begin_inset Formula $d=a_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 We have restricted ourselves only to the case where the force is continuous.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This model has been shown to match several features of experimental energy
 dissipation measurements well, and it is well suited to analysis (e.g.
 the method of averaging).
 However, for numerical simulation it can present a problem.
 The switch between the approach and retract forces happens instantaneously.
 This means that the force is discontinuous at the switch, which is clearly
 non-physical.
 This may cause difficulties for the differential equation solver, and it
 can also introduce non-physical high frequency oscillation of the cantilever.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, we suggest a modification which allows the force to be continuous
 everywhere.
 Initially, 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{d}<0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{ts}(d)=F_{ts,app}(d)$
\end_inset

.
 If, at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t=t_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $d=d_{0}$
\end_inset

, the velocity switches sign from 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{d}<0$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{d}>0$
\end_inset

, then the force for time 
\begin_inset Formula $t>t_{0}$
\end_inset

 is defined as 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{ts}(d)=F_{ts,ret}(d)+\left(F_{ts,app}(d_{0})-F_{ts,ret}(d_{0})\right)e^{-(d-d_{0})/\lambda}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is a decay length (we use 0.1 nm typically).
 In other words, when the velocity switches, the current trajectory is smoothly
 transitioned into the new trajectory.
 The difference between the current and new trajectories decays exponentially.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above definition is sufficient for single frequency AFM (e.g.
 tapping mode).
 However, for bimodal AFM, it is possible that the velocity might reverse
 two (or more) times, and the second reversal might happen before the transition
 to the new trajectory is complete.
 Therefore, we instead use this definition: If the velocity reverses at
 time 
\begin_inset Formula $t=t_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $d=d_{0}$
\end_inset

, then then let 
\begin_inset Formula $F^{*}$
\end_inset

 be the force at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 Then the force for time 
\begin_inset Formula $t>t_{0}$
\end_inset

 is defined as 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{ts}=F_{ts,m}(d)+\left(F^{*}-F_{ts,m}(d_{0})\right)e^{(-d-d_{0})/\lambda}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 equals either 
\begin_inset Formula $app$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $ret$
\end_inset

, depending on which direction the velocity has switched to.
 This allows an arbitrary number of reversals at arbitrary distances, while
 still always maintaining continuity of the forces.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Non-smoothness of the interaction force models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that all the tip-sample interaction models above describe interaction
 forces that are mostly continuous with respect to the tip-sample gap 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

.
 However at the critical gap value (
\begin_inset Formula $d=0$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $d=a_{0}$
\end_inset

) when the repulsive force model begins, the 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{ts}$
\end_inset

 vs.
 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 curve becomes non-smooth.
 This is important because performing numerical simulations of tip motion
 with non-smooth interactions creates the possibility of errors creeping
 in due to the choice of the numerical integration scheme.
 In VEDA we do not artificially smooth out such forces but rather retain
 them in their ideal form and instead rely on specialized numerical integration
 schemes to deal with such non-smooth forces.

Tip samples interaction: Viscoelasticity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An elastic material is one where the stress (forces) at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 depends only on the strain (displacements) at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, and does not depend on the rate of strain, or on any past history of the
 strain.
 For example, a steel spring could be considered as an elastic body.
 A viscous material, on the other hand, is one in which the stresses are
 dependent on only on the strain rate (velocity).
 For example, most common liquids such as water or oil.
 Many materials, however, display some mixture of viscous and elastic response.
 That is, the stresses may depend both on the current strain as well as
 the strain rate and the past history of the strain.
 This is called viscoelasticity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several different continuum models for viscoelasticity, which
 can be combined with the tip-sample interaction models above in a few different
 ways.

Viscoelasticity based on Linear Contact
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The linear contact model was described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sssec:lincon"

\end_inset

.
 In this model, the tip-sample interaction force is represented by a simple
 spring.
 To extend this model to viscoelasticity, we simply add linear dashpots
 (and possibly some extra springs).
 The dashpot can be combined in with the spring in several different ways
 (i.e.
 series versus parallel).
 The Kelvin-Voigt viscoelastic dissipation model assumes a spring in parallel
 with a damper.
 This model is applicable when the relaxation time of the material is very
 short (compared to the tip-sample contact time).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A naive implementation of this model would be to simply add the spring and
 dashpot forces.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 be the damping coefficient in N-s/m.
 Then the force is given by:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
F_{ts}(d)=\begin{cases}
0, & d>0\\
-k_{ts}^{rep}d-\eta\dot{d}, & d<0
\end{cases}\label{eq:kv}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This referred to in VEDA as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ad-hoc kelvin-voigt
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 model (for linear contact) and this was the default model prior to 2.0.22
 (Aug 2011).
 However, there is a problem with this model: for very viscous samples the
 total force can go negative, which is non-physical.
 The linear contact model does not include any attractive forces, so the
 tip should leave contact with the sample instead of the force going negative.
 Therefore, we introduce an extra condition as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
F_{ts}(d)=\begin{cases}
0, & d>0\\
-k_{ts}^{rep}d-\eta\dot{d}, & -k_{ts}^{rep}d-\eta\dot{d}>0\\
0, & \mathrm{otherwise}
\end{cases}\label{eq:kv}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The condition on the second line prevents the force from being negative.
 For the linear attractive/repulsive model (section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sssec:lincona"

\end_inset

), the condition is modified to allow the force to go negative up to the
 adhesion force.
 This condition is, admittedly, somewhat ad-hoc, but the linear model is
 ad-hoc to begin with.
 The Hertz contact based models (described below) have a more rigorously
 developed viscoelastic theory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The biggest problem with this model is that the viscous force is discontinuous.
 Immediately upon entering contact the force can be huge.
 If you have convergence problems with this model, try to using another
 model (or Hertz contact) instead
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It may be instructive to compute the energy dissipated per cycle for this
 model in the case of permanent contact with the sample.
 
\begin_inset Formula $W=\oint F_{ts}(d,\dot{d})dd=\intop_{0}^{2\pi/\omega}F_{ts}(d,\dot{d})\dot{d}dt$
\end_inset

 Assume a sinusoidal 
\begin_inset Formula $d=A\cos(\omega t)$
\end_inset

.
 Then
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
W=-\intop_{\pi/\omega}^{2\pi/\omega}\eta(\omega A\sin(\omega t))^{2}dt=\frac{\pi}{2}\eta\omega A^{2}.\label{eq:diss-visc}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that this term includes 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

.
 The energy loss per cycle depends on the frequency, thus this is classified
 as a rate dependent dissipation model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For linear contact, we can also formulate the response for the three element
 model.
 This consists of two springs and one dashpot arranged as in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:viscoelastic_elements"

\end_inset

.
 We can derive the force as follows: Let the compression of spring 1 be
 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{1}$
\end_inset

 and force in spring 1 be 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{1}d_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 Then let then compression of the spring-dashpot pair be 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{2}$
\end_inset

 and the force is 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{2}=k_{2}d_{2}+\eta\dot{d}_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Then, the two contraints on the system are the overall displacement of
 the system 
\begin_inset Formula $d=d_{1}+d_{2}$
\end_inset

 and the force in each set is the same 
\begin_inset Formula $F=F_{1}=F_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Using these conditions, we arrive at a governing differential equation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
k_{1}d(t)=(k_{1}+k_{2})d_{2}(t)+\eta\dot{d}_{2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
which can be solved for 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{2}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
d_{2}\left(t\right)=\frac{k_{1}}{\eta}{{\rm e}^{-{\frac{t\left(k_{1}+k_{2}\right)}{\eta}}}}\int_{0}^{t}\!d\left(\tau\right){{\rm e}^{{\frac{\left(k_{1}+k_{2}\right)\tau}{\eta}}}}{d\tau}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From this and 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{2}=k_{2}d_{2}+\eta\dot{d}_{2}$
\end_inset

, the force can be found.
 This model has the advantage that the force is not discontinuous upon contact,
 unlike the Kelvin-voigt model.
 For a sinusoidal excitation 
\begin_inset Formula $d(t)=A\sin(\omega t)$
\end_inset

, this is solved to yield 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{2}(t)=k_{1}A\left(-\eta\omega\cos(\omega t)+(k_{1}+k_{2})\sin(\omega t)\right)/\left(k_{1}^{2}+2k_{1}k_{2}+k_{2}^{2}+\omega^{2}\eta^{2}\right)$

Hertz contact based viscoelasticity, Kelvin-Voigt
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the Hertz (and related) tip-sample interaction models, the force calculation
 is more complex than for linear contact.
 The elastic Hertz formulas in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Hertz"

\end_inset

 were derived by calculating the area of contact between the tip and the
 sample that would occur for a given indentation.
 From the contact area, a contact force can be computed.
 Therefore to calculate the viscoelastic response, we must take the contact
 area into account.
 We start with the simple Kelvin-voigt model and then extend to other models
 in subsequent sections.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before describing the full Kelvin-voigt model, we also briefly mention the
 
\emph on
ad-hoc
\emph default
 Kelvin-voigt model.
 This was the model used in VEDA prior to version 2.0.22 (Apr 2010), and it
 has been used in the literature several times (for example 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Garcia_PRL_2006, Melcher_PNAS_2009"
literal "true"

\end_inset

).
 The model is deriving by assuming that the viscoelastic material's contact
 area and sample deformation are related to the identation by the exact
 same formula as in the purely elastic problem.
 This leads to the combined elastic plus viscous force being
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
F_{ts}(d,\dot{d})=\left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
0, & d>0\\
\frac{4}{3}E^{*}\sqrt{R}(-d)^{3/2}-\eta\dot{d}\sqrt{-Rd}, & d\leqslant0
\end{array}\right.\label{eq:kv-hertz}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, there are two problems with this model.
 First, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{d}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 are large, then it is possible for 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{ts}$
\end_inset

 to be negative.
 But the Hertz contact model should not include any attractive forces, so
 this is non-physical.
 Put another way, as the tip withdraws, the deformed sample does not return
 to its original condition instantly, but it takes some time to relax because
 of the viscoelasticity.
 If the tip withdraws too fast, then it may completely pull away from the
 sample before 
\begin_inset Formula $d=0$
\end_inset

.
 However, the ad-hoc model cannot account for this.
 Essentially, if the tip pulls away quickly, the ad-hoc model is applying
 an attractive force to slow it down and forcing it to withdraw only as
 fast as the sample can relax.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reason that the model has this error is the assumption that the contact
 area and indentation were related by the same formulas as in the elastic
 case.
 The correct formula take into account a different relation between them.
 According to the so called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

correspondance principle
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 if the solution to an elastic problem is known, then the solution to the
 corresponding viscoelastic solution is found by replacing the shear modulus
 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 with a viscoelastic operator appropriate to the material 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "mase1999continuum"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 Therefore, in the standard contact mechanics theory 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "johnson_1985, lee1960contact"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, the solution for viscoelastic contact is found by taking the Hertz formula
 
\begin_inset Formula $F=\frac{4}{3}E^{*}\sqrt{R}d^{3/2}=\frac{8}{3(1-\nu)}G\sqrt{R}d^{3/2}$
\end_inset

 and replacing 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 with a convolution integral
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
F(t)=\frac{8}{3(1-\nu)}\sqrt{R}\intop_{0}^{t}\psi(t-\tau)\frac{d}{d\tau}d^{3/2}(\tau)d\tau\label{eq:visc-conv}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is the stress relaxation operator for the linear viscoelastic material
 in question.
 This operator describes the stress in the material if a step change in
 strain is applied.
 For the Kelvin-voigt model, this is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\psi(t)=G+\eta\delta(t)\label{eq:kv-relaxation}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 is the Dirac delta.
 That is to say, a step change in strain is a delta function in strain rate,
 and in the Kelvin-voigt model the visous portion of the stress is directly
 proportional to strain rate.
 Another way to say this is that the stress relaxes instantly after the
 load is applied.
 The delta function in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:kv-relaxation"

\end_inset

 makes the convolution integral 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:visc-conv"

\end_inset

 particularly simple to evaluate.
 We have merely 
\begin_inset Formula $F(t)=\frac{4}{3}E^{*}\sqrt{R}d^{3/2}-\frac{2\eta}{1-\nu}\dot{d}\sqrt{-Rd}$
\end_inset

.
 This is similar to the ad-hoc model.
 However, there is one caveat.
 This theory only applies when the contact area is increasing (i.e.
 when the tip is going down into the sample).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the contact area is decreasing (tip is withdrawing), the theory of
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ting1966"

\end_inset

 must be used.
 The first step is to find the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{1}$
\end_inset

 that satisfies the formula
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\int_{t_{1}(t)}^{t}\psi(t-\tau)\frac{\partial}{\partial\tau}d(\tau)d\tau=0\label{eq:int_t1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When this formula is satisfied, the contact area (i.e.
 radius of the circle of contact) at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{1}$
\end_inset

 and time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 will be the same.
 For Kelvin-Voigt, we substitute 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:kv-relaxation"

\end_inset

 in and use the properties of Dirac delta [note: A commonly given definition
 of the Dirac delta is 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\delta(x)dx=1$
\end_inset

.
 In this case we are integrating over a smaller interval so we need the
 definition 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{0}^{\infty}\delta(x)dx=1/2$
\end_inset

] to find:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
G\left(d(t)-d(t_{1})\right)+\frac{1}{2}\eta\dot{d}(t)=0
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and then re-arrange:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
d(t_{1})=d(t)+\frac{1}{2}\frac{\eta}{G}\dot{d}(t)\label{eq:kv_t1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, we can find 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{1}$
\end_inset

 by simply looking backwards through the indentation history to find the
 time at which this value of indentation occured.
 Now that we know 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{1}$
\end_inset

, we can find the force from 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:visc-conv"

\end_inset

, except we must change the limits of integration to
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
F(t)=\frac{8}{3(1-\nu)}\sqrt{R}\intop_{0}^{t_{1}}\psi(t-\tau)\frac{d}{d\tau}d^{3/2}(\tau)d\tau
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, we can write the entire force model as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
F(d,\dot{d},t)=\begin{cases}
0 & m=0\textrm{ (not in contact)}\\
\frac{8}{3(1-\nu)}\sqrt{R}\int_{t_{0}}^{t}\psi(t-\tau)\frac{d}{d\tau}d^{3/2}(\tau)d\tau, & m=1,\dot{d}<0\textrm{ (indentation increasing)}\\
\frac{8}{3(1-\nu)}\sqrt{R}\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}\psi(t-\tau)\frac{d}{d\tau}d^{3/2}(\tau)d\tau, & m=1,\dot{d}>0\textrm{ (indentation decreasing)}
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 is a mode variable that keeps track of if the tip is in contact or not.
 The non-contact to contact transition (
\begin_inset Formula $m=0$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $m=1$
\end_inset

 ) happens when tip-sample gap transitions when 
\begin_inset Formula $d<0$
\end_inset

 .
 The contact to non-contact transition (
\begin_inset Formula $m=1$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $m=0$
\end_inset

 ) happens when either 
\begin_inset Formula $d>0$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{1}<t_{0}$
\end_inset

 , where 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{0}$
\end_inset

 is the time at which the non-contact to contact transition occurred,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, for Kelvin-voigt, we know that 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{1}<t$
\end_inset

, so the Dirac delta simplifies and we have merely 
\begin_inset Formula $F(t)=\frac{4}{3}E^{*}\sqrt{R}d(t_{1})^{3/2}$
\end_inset

.
 But, we already know 
\begin_inset Formula $d(t_{1})$
\end_inset

 from 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:kv_t1"

\end_inset

.
 Therefore, it is not necessary that we actually find 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 We can use
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
F(t)=\frac{4}{3}E^{*}\sqrt{R}(d(t)+\frac{1}{2}\frac{\eta}{G}\dot{d}(t))^{3/2}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, the entire force model is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
F_{ts}(d,\dot{d})=\left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
0, & m=0\\
\frac{4}{3}E^{*}\sqrt{R}(-d)^{3/2}-\frac{2}{(1-\nu)}\eta\dot{d}\sqrt{-Rd}, & m=1,\dot{d}<0\\
\frac{4}{3}E^{*}\sqrt{R}(-d-\frac{1}{2}\frac{\eta}{G}\dot{d})^{3/2} & m=1,\dot{d}>0,
\end{array}\right\} 
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The tip first contacts the sample (
\begin_inset Formula $m=0$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $m=1$

\end_inset

 , and contact is broken (
\begin_inset Formula $m=1$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $m=0$
\end_inset

 transition) when either 
\begin_inset Formula $d>0$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $-d-\frac{1}{2}\frac{\eta}{G}\dot{d}<0$
\end_inset

 .
 An example force curve is shown in Figure

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These models assume that the sample can be approximated by a semi-infinite
 half-space.
 Also, the tip is assumed to be rigid (i.e.
 the modulus of the tip is assumed to be much higher than the modulus of
 the sample).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Viscoelastic forces are not applicable to models not based on Hertz contact
 (e.g.
 Morse or Lennard-Jones potential models).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we have not yet described how to take into account any attractive
 forces.
 In VEDA we include only a simple ad-hoc implementation of a DMT like attractive
 force model with the viscoelastic models.
 The assumptions are that 1) there is no energy dissipation when the tip
 is no touching the sample.
 2) the sample does not neck.
 3) the attractive forces saturate at a fixed value (
\begin_inset Formula $F_{ad}=-HR/(6a_{0}^{2})$
\end_inset

) below 
\begin_inset Formula $d=a_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 In this case we can simply add the van der Waals forces directly to the
 viscoelastic forces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
F_{ts}(d,\dot{d})=\left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
0, & m=0\\
\frac{4}{3}E^{*}\sqrt{R}(-d)^{3/2}-\frac{2}{(1-\nu)}\eta\dot{d}\sqrt{-Rd}, & m=1,\dot{d}<0\\
\frac{4}{3}E^{*}\sqrt{R}(-d-\frac{1}{2}\frac{\eta}{G}\dot{d})^{3/2} & m=1,\dot{d}>0,
\end{array}\right\} +\left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
-\frac{HR}{6d^{2}}, & d>a_{o}\\
-\frac{HR}{6a_{0}^{2}}, & d\leqslant a_{0}
\end{array}\right\} 
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the sample necks (i.e.
 deforms even when tip and sample are not in contact), then this model will
 not be applicable.
 In that case a DMT contact is not applicable and a JKR type contact is
 more relevant.
 However, Viscoelasticity in conjunction with JKR contact is based on an
 entirely different set of theory which is significantly more complicated,
 and is not available currently in VEDA.

The creep compliance function for the generalized Maxwell model is not easy

.
 There is also a generalized Kelvin-voigt model, consisting of a number
 of elements in series.
 For generalized kelvin-voigt, the creep compliance function can be easily
 written directly, but the stress relaxation function is difficult to find
 (but not impossible).
 Because the formulation of the equations here requires the stress relaxation
 function, we do not implement a generalized Kelvin-voigt model in VEDA.
 If you need to simulate a model described by generalized Kelvin-voigt,
 we suggest that you find the stress relaxation function for it, and then
 convert to an equivalent generalized Maxwell model.

The properties of viscoelastic materials are often described using a concept
 called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

dynamic elastic modulus
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The traditional Young's modulus is replaced with a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

storage modulus
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that describes conservative response and a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

loss modulus
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that describes energy dissipation.
 Unfortunately, there is currently no good way to directly use these storage
 and loss modulii in VEDA.
 If you have storage and loss modulus data versus frequency for a material
 of interest, you must fit the data to a Prony series and then perform the
 simulation using the Generalized maxwell model.
 More details will be added to this section in future releases.

The above several subsections dealt with the extension of the elastic Hertz
 contact problem to a viscoelastic material.
 This theory is satisfactory in many cases, however, there are two big limitatio

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The numerical calculations are only reasonable for the situation where the
 contact area increases monotonically to a single maximum and then decreases
 monotonically to zero.
 This usually the case for standard tapping mode.
 However, for bimodal AFM, the contact area may have any number of minima
 and maxima during a single tap.
 Although 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 This is an entirely different approach.
 It is more akin to a finite element or boundary element method than a contact
 mechanics problem.
 We discrete the sample surface with a mesh, and then solve for the deflection
 and pressure at each point explicitly.
 This removes all assumptions about the relations between contact area,
 indentation, and force, and allows the use of arbitrary attractive forces.

This section is devoted to modeling the dynamics of the continuous cantilever
 beam as it interacts with a sample.
 A continuous beam is represented by an infinite DOF system, where each
 DOF corresponds to an eigenmode of the beam.
 Any numerical simulation of a cantilever beam involves an approximate truncated
 DOF model where only a finite number of eigenmodes are retained.
 In conventional dAFM in air or vacuum where the excitation frequency is
 near the resonance of the first eigenmode, a single DOF (point-mass) model

Before proceeding with a rigorous mathematical derivation, let us consider
 a simple physical concept.
 For the time being, all we need to know about continuous vibrations is
 that vibrations of a continuous beam may be decomposed into eigenmodes;
 each of which represents one DOF of an infinite DOF system.
 Accordingly, each eigenmode can be represented as an equivalent point mass
 model

 Consequently, the generalized coordinates

Bernoulli-Euler beam model

\begin_layout Standard
The classical Bernoulli-Euler beam model is applicable to small deflections
 of slender, uniform beams.
 Here, we develop a model for the dynamics of the AFM probe from Bernoulli-Euler
 beam theory.
 In this section we have assumed:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The AFM probe is a diving-board type cantilever that can be modeled in theory
 as a slender, uniform, and rectangular beam.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Deflection amplitudes of the cantilever tip are very small relative to the
 cantilever length.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A probe tip located at the free-end of the cantilever has a small but finite
 mass and negligible rotational inertia.
 This assumption hinges on the fact that most tips are conical or pyramidal,
 and should have relatively small rotational inertia about their bases.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
All of the damping comes from hydrodynamic forces, and internal damping
 of the cantilever is negligible.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\rho_{c}\ddot{w}(x,t)+F_{hydro}(\dot{w}(x,t))+E_{c}I_{c}w''''(x,t)=F_{ts}(d,\dot{d})\delta(x-L_{c})+F_{mag}(t),\label{eq:pdew}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is the axial coordinate along the cantilever's longitudinal axis, 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{c}$

 is the length, dots represent temporal derivatives, primes are derivatives
 with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $x$

\begin_inset Formula $E_{c}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $I_{c}$
\end_inset

 are the linear density, elastic modulus and area moment of inertia respectively.
 The absolute deflection, 
\begin_inset Formula $w(x,t)=Z(t)+y(t)+u(x,t)$
\end_inset

, is composed of the separation from the sample, 
\begin_inset Formula $Z(t)$

\begin_inset Formula $u(x,t)$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $F_{mag}$
\end_inset

 represents a uniformly distributed magnetic excitation.
 If the cantilever is acoustically excited, 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{mag}$

 is set to zero.
 Otherwise, 
\begin_inset Formula $y(t)=0$

Typically in dAFM, a photodiode measures the bending angle 
\begin_inset Formula $u'(L,t)$

\begin_inset Formula $u(L,t)$
\end_inset

 relative to the base, therefore, we proceed to model the dynamics of the
 cantilever in the non-inertial, moving frame attached to the cantilever's
 base.
 The equation of motion (Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

) in the non-inertial frame attached to the moving base is: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\rho_{c}\ddot{u}(x,t)+F_{hydro}(\dot{u}(x,t)+\dot{y}(t)+\dot{Z}(t))+E_{c}I_{c}u''''(x,t)=F_{ts}(d,\dot{d})\delta(x-L_{c})-\rho_{c}\ddot{y}(t)+F_{mag}(t).\label{eq:pdeu}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regarding 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{hydro}$
\end_inset

, we assume that the Reynold's number is low so that force due to 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{u}(x,t)$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{y}(t)$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{Z}(t)$
\end_inset

 can be treated by linear superposition.
 Also because of the low Reynold's number, we expect the damping force to
 have a linear dependence velocity.
 Now 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{Z}(t)$
\end_inset

 will typically have much lower frequency content than 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{u}(x,t)$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{y}(t)$
\end_inset

, so we allow difference coefficients.
 Thus, 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{hydro}(\dot{u}(x,t)+\dot{y}(t)+\dot{Z}(t))=\gamma_{f}\dot{u}(x,t)+\gamma_{f}\dot{y}(t)+\gamma_{d}\dot{Z}(t)$

 Note while the velocity of the Z-piezo motion 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{Z}(t)$
\end_inset

 is nonzero when scanning and its acceleration 
\begin_inset Formula $\ddot{Z}(t)$
\end_inset

 is also nonzero while scanning, it is reasonable to assume 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{Z}(t)\ll\dot{y}(t)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\ddot{Z}(t)\ll\ddot{y(t)}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, in the scanning tool we neglect hydrodynamic and inertial forces
 due to 
\begin_inset Formula $Z(t)$
\end_inset

 In the F-Z Curves and the approach curves tools, 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{d}\dot{Z}(t)$

\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{c}\ddot{Z}(t)$
\end_inset

 is neglected (for those tools 
\begin_inset Formula $\ddot{Z}(t)$
\end_inset

 would only be non-zero at the very beginning and end of the approach anyway).
 In the frequency sweep tool,

 reduces to 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\rho_{c}\ddot{u}(x,t)+E_{c}I_{c}u''''(x,t)=0.\label{eq:pdeu}

\end_inset

The solution process for solving Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 This yields two ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for the temporal

 The ODE describing the temporal component

While

 As tip mass is added to the cantilever, the outer-most node of higher eigenmode
s gradually move towards the tip.
 When a node is close to the free-end, large amounts of kinetic and potential
 energy are present for small deflections of the tip in that eigenmode.
 This results in large stiffnesses and masses of the higher eigenmodes

At this point, note that the damping terms still have off-diagonal elements
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{tip}$
\end_inset

 is non-zero.
 Thus the damped eigenmodes are not diagonal in the basis of undamped eigenmodes.
 Equivalently speaking, the modal equations we have developed are coupled.
 However, in VEDA, we neglect the off diagonal terms and work with uncoupled
 equations.
 This is valid for the following reasons: in air, the damping is very small,
 and therefore it has little overall effect on the eigenmodes, and the undamped
 and damped eigenmodes are nearly identical.
 In liquid, the off-diagonal terms are small compared to the on-diagonal
 terms, therefore we can neglect them.

 This works by running an time-varying electrical current through a wire
 loop on the cantilever.
 When a constant external magnetic field is applied, this generates a uniform
 force distribution on the cantilever such that 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x,t)=f_{mag}\cos{\omega_{d}t}$

The other common method is to make the cantilever a permanent magnet.
 This could be either with a thin coating of a magnetic material (such as
 Agilent's MAC mode), or a small magnetic particle glued to the cantilever.

 We include only a very simplified model here.
 First, we assume that the laser spot is positioned in a location on the
 cantilever where it excites mainly the first eigenmode and the excitation
 of the other eigenmodes is negligible.
 Second, we assume that both the magnitude and phase of the excitation force
 change linearly with frequency.
 That is, we assume 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{1}^{pt}=F_{pt}c_{1}(\bar{\Omega}_{d,1}-1)\cos(\Omega_{d}\tau+c_{2}(\bar{\Omega}_{d,1}-1))$

\begin_layout Standard
I suggest that you make use of the time history outputs (on

 tab).
 This will allow you to see the cantilever deflection and applied force
 as a function of time so that you can see how I am doing the gain and saturatio
n, and how the cantilever responds to the force.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because this is still in beta testing, there are a few limitations:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1) We only implemented the self-excitation for magnetic drive.
 For acoustic (piezo) drive it is more complicated because we must keep
 track of both the base position and the forces.
 For air (high Q), the magnetic drive and the acoustic drive will give the
 same answer anyway so it does not matter.
 For liquids, acoustic and magnetic is very different.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "basso2008modelling"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 suggests that the phase delay between the motion of the base and the modal
 forcing on the cantilever provides a natural phase delay and that a phase
 shifter is not strictly necessary.
 However, per above, we use only a magnetic force that is assumed to act
 instantly.
 Therefore it may be necessary to introduce a phase delay.
 However, we have actually not implemented a true phase shifter, but a rather
 a simple time delay.
 That is, we read the cantilever motion, wait a specified amount of time,
 and then output the force.
 For air (high Q), the cantilever motion will be dominated by a single harmonic
 anyway, so this delay is fine.
 For liquids (low Q), the cantilever motion may include higher harmonics.
 In this case the time delay might not represent your physical system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3) Finally, the output is reported using a lock-in amplifier model that
 has a center frequency as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

driving frequency
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, even though the self-excitation may stabilize on a solution that is not
 exactly at the first natural frequency.
 Therefore you may need a wide bandwidth on the lock-in amplifier to get
 the correct amplitude signal (and the phase signal might not be defined
 very well).
 In the future, we might want to use an RMS measurement of amplitude, or
 use a Phase-locked-loop to track the self-excitation frequency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So essentially, the current implementation should work fairly well for simulatio
ns in air.
 For simulations of liquid (Q < 10) it may not work as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Extensions to triangular and other non-standard geometries
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the discretized models in this section are derived for rectangular
 beams, the results provide a reasonable approximation for triangular cantilever
s and other geometries under standard operating conditions and as long as
 the quality factors are sufficiently large (
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{1}\gtrsim20$
\end_inset

) - a condition that is typically met for cantilevers oscillating in ambient
 conditions.
 By standard operating conditions, we mean that a single drive frequency
 is tuned to the natural frequency of the fundamental eigenmode (
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{d}=\omega_{1}$
\end_inset

), and the natural frequencies of higher eigenmodes do not lie within integer
 multiples of the fundamental.
 In this case, if 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{1}\gtrsim20$
\end_inset

, only the fundamental eigenmode will contribute significantly to the cantilever
 dynamics.
 The motion of the base of the cantilever should be very small in the case
 of acoustic excitation, and one can show the difference between magnetic
 and acoustic excitation sources is negligible.
 Also, the photodiode deflection 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{p}(t)$
\end_inset

 is approximately the response of the fundamental eigenmode 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}(t)$
\end_inset

.
 Finally, for non-rectangular geometries, calibration of the stiffness 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{1}$
\end_inset

 may require thermal calibration methods to insure accurate predictions

Models for lock-in amplifiers and noise
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In dynamic AFM (both amplitude modulated and frequency modulated), the controlle
r's objective is to maintain a constant tip amplitude as the AFM cantilever
 probes the sample in the presence of tip-sample interaction forces.
 To do this, an accurate measurement of the amplitude is needed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In commercial AFMs, the amplitude of the photodiode signal is generally
 measured using a lock-in amplifier.
 A lock-in multiplies the photodiode signal with the drive (reference) signal
 or possibly a higher harmonic of the drive signal.
 Since both of these signals are approximately sinusoidal, resulting in
 a signal of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $(A\sin(\omega t))2\sin(\omega t)=A-A\sin(2\omega t)$
\end_inset

.
 Then a low pass filter is used to remove the 
\begin_inset Formula $2\omega$
\end_inset

 component leaving only the constant 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 component.
 The choice of the low-pass filter time constant involves a trade-off between
 a quick time-domain response of the filter and noise rejection.
 With a long filter time constant, the filter will average over many drive
 cycles and thus give a clean signal.
 However, it will take the filter longer to respond to a change in the signal.
 With a short filter time constant, the filter will average over fewer drive
 cycles and thus response is much quicker, but noise and even nonlinearities,
 such as the higher harmonics, may distort the measurement.
 In the current version of VEDA, you can choose from either a 1st, 2nd or
 4th order Butterworth filter with various choices of time constant.
 Random noise can also be added directly to the deflection signal to simulate
 measurement shot noise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another way to compute the amplitude is by a Fourier transform over a specified
 number of oscillation cycles and then extracting the amplitude at the drive
 frequency.
 This method usually has better noise rejection than the lock-in method.
 Therefore, comparing the amplitude and phase as measured by the fourier
 integral to the amplitude and phase as measured by the lock-in can often
 serve as an indicator of whether the choosen lock-in model is good.
 But there are two situations where the fourier integral method performs
 worse than a lock-in.
 The integral needs to be computed over an integer number of drive cycles
 to avoid spectral leakage.
 For fixed frequency tools this is not a problem, but for frequency modulation
 where the frequency can changes at every step it is not always possible
 to get an integer number of drive cycles.
 Additionally, in certain oscillation regimes (e.g.
 chaos) it is impossible.
 In this cases the Fourier integrals may be unreliable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the tools which use feedback control, VEDA will plot both the Fourier
 transform amplitude and the lock-in amplitude.
 But, only the lock-in amplitude is used for feedback control (this is a
 difference from previous versions, which did not have a lock-in model and
 thus used the Fourier analysis for feedback control).
 The basic versions of some tools plot only one method or the other to avoid
 unecessarily complicating the ouput for begining users.

Models for AM controller dynamics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Amplitude Modulated (AM) AFM, when the response amplitude deviates from
 the desired amplitude, the Z displacement is adjusted accordingly and recorded
 as the sample topography.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For scanning simulations, we choose a simple proportional-integral (PI)
 controller to maintain the desired amplitude.
 A block diagram of the feedback scheme is shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:AM-blockdia"

\end_inset

 This is the typical controller used in most commercial AFM instruments
 today.
 More specifically, the feedback parameter is the amplitude error, 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

, which is defined as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
e=A_{1}/A_{0}-A_{sp}\label{error}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{sp}$
\end_inset

 are the current amplitude of the primary harmonic and the set-point amplitude
 ratio respectively.
 Based on the amplitude error, the Z displacement from the sample is adjusted
 according to: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Delta Z(t_{n})=\left(-K_{P}e(t_{n})-\frac{K_{I}}{f_{s}}\sum_{i=1}^{i=n}e(t_{i})\right)\label{eq:cont}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where, 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{P}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{I}$
\end_inset

 are the proportional and integral gain constants, 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{s}$
\end_inset

 is the sampling frequency, and 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{n}=n/f_{s}$
\end_inset

.
 Note, the controller used in versions 2.0.6 and forward is slightly different
 than previous controllers.
 You will need slightly different gains to achieve the same response (the
 previous controller had an extra integrator block in Figure

The controller scheme for frequency modulated (FM) AFM is significantly
 more complicated.
 A block diagram is shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:FM-blockdia"

\end_inset

.
 Three separate controllers are used.
 First, a Phase Locked Loop (PLL) is used to adjust the drive frequency.
 As the tip interacts with the sample, attractive forces will effectively
 make the system softer and lower the resonant frequency.
 Repulsive forces will effectively make the system stiffer and increase
 the resonant frequency.
 The PLL changes the drive frequency to follow the resonant frequency so
 that the cantilever is always driven at resonance.
 Then, an second controller is used to increase the driving force (either
 magnetic force for magnetic drive or base amplitude for acoustic drive)
 to maintain a constant amplitude.
 Finally, a Z controller adjusts the height in order to keep the frequency
 shift from the PLL constant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some commercial AFMs use a different scheme.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 is nearly 90 degrees when the controller is operating properly, and since
 
\begin_inset Formula $\cos(\phi)\approx\phi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sin(\phi)\approx1$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 is nearly 90 degrees, 
\begin_inset Formula $Y\approx A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $X\approx A\phi$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, some AFMs use the 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 channels in the feedback controllers, skipping the step of computing true
 amplitude and phase.
 This generally does not make much difference to the results for properly
 tuned controllers.
 VEDA allows simulating both conditions.

 though F is already in the contact region, and then use the contact interaction

 Adaptive time-step integration routines tend to reduce the time-step close
 to the boundary.
 Figure

 indicates that adaptive time-step routines integrate from A to D with the
 noncontact interaction model, and then integrate from D to E with the contact

 Adaptive time-step routines still cannot detect the position of the boundary
 in order to integrate around the boundary.
 Unless extremely small time-steps are chosen, conventional integration
 routines cannot accurately integrate the non-smooth interaction forces.

The DDASKR routine uses a root finding algorithm to detect the sample boundary,

 from A to the boundary position B, then apply the contact interaction model

\begin_inset Formula $ith$
\end_inset

 eigenmode.
 So then the final energy balance for the 
\begin_inset Formula $ith$
\end_inset

 mode is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta E_{tot,i}+E_{med,i}=E_{prop,i}+E_{drive,i}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Separator latexpar
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
For periodic motion at steady state, the eigenmode will have no overall
 change in energy during the drive cycle: 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta E_{tot,i}=0$
\end_inset

.
 So merely: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E_{med,i}=E_{prop,i}+E_{drive,i}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In some cases, a term of interest is the total energy lost due to tip-sample
 dissipation.
 This is defined as 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{ts}=-\int_{0}^{T}F_{ts}(d,\dot{d})\dot{d}dt$
\end_inset

.
 For magnetic excitation (and assuming 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{Z}\ll1$
\end_inset

), 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{d}=\sum\dot{q_{i}}$
\end_inset

 from which we can rewrite 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{ts}=-\underset{i}{\sum}E_{prop,i}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus it is sometimes convenient to re-write the energy balance as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E_{med,i}+\underset{j\neq i}{\sum}E_{prop,j}+E_{ts}=E_{drive,i}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But for acoustic mode, 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{d}=\dot{y}+\sum\dot{q_{i}}$
\end_inset

, so there is an additional term 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{bs}=\int_{0}^{T}F_{ts}(d,\dot{d})\dot{y}dt$
\end_inset

 which we refer to as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

base sample work
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{ts}=-\underset{i}{\sum}E_{prop,i}-E_{bs}$
\end_inset

 and the energy balance for acoustic mode is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E_{med,i}+\underset{j\neq i}{\sum}E_{prop,j}+E_{ts}+E_{bs}=E_{drive,i}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, for comparison to published work it is often useful to plot Anczykowski
's formula 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Anczykowski_ASURF_1999"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 for energy dissipation in tapping mode, which is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P=\frac{1}{2}\frac{k\omega_{0}}{Q_{cant}}[A_{0}A\sin(\phi)-A^{2}\frac{\omega}{\omega_{0}}]
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that this formula was originally described as calculating the tip-sample
 energy dissipation.
 In actuality it computes energy lost from the first harmonic, which could
 also be energy going to other harmonics / eigenmodes.
 If you actually want to see tip-sample energy dissipation, VEDA computes
 that directly.
 Use this formula only for comparison to published work that has used this
 formula.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, it is also useful to have measures of the conservative stored energy.
 The typical quantity used in the AFM literature is called the virial.
 The virial for the 
\emph on
i
\emph default
th eigenmode is calculated as follows 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "lozano_prB_2009"
literal "true"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
V_{i}=\frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T}F_{ts}(d,\dot{d})q_{i}(t)dt
\]

\end_inset

This is similar to the energy dissipation equation except that the velocity
 has been replaced by displacement.
 Also, the 1/T term indicates that this is the time-averaged conservative
 work over the cycle, as opposed to the dissipation where we are reporting
 the sum total dissipation over the cycle.
 In VEDA we numerically calculate the virial for each eigenmode and then
 report the summed virial for all eigenmodes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note: earlier versions of VEDA had a bug which caused the reported value
 of dissipation to be higher than the actual value by a factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi$
\end_inset

.
 This bug was corrected in version 2.1.11 (September 2014)

\begin_layout Itemize
Version 2.2.0, 9 December 2020.
 The major development in this version was the introduction of a new tool
 Amplitude Modulated Approach Curves using a Steady State solution, described
 in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:AM-SS"

\end_inset

, which uses a completely different numerical approach than the rest of
 the VEDA tools.
 The motivation behind this tool was to allow simulations with the Attard
 model (section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:attard"

\end_inset

), which are prohibitively slow using the normal tools.
 However, it can be used with any tip-sample interaction model.
 The assumptions behind this tool make it only valid for high Q environments
 (air & vaccuum).

Appendix: Installing and Using VEDA on your local machine
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
VEDA has been designed to run in your web browser through www.nanohub.org,
 a website run by the Network for Computational Nanotechnology.
 Some advanced users, however, may wish to install VEDA on their local machines.
 The advantages of this are: 1) ability to run VEDA without Internet access
 (at a conference perhaps), 2) ability to load and save input and output
 files, 3) ability to perform multiple batch runs (e.g.
 several of the author's publications have included data from several hundred
 runs that were done in a batch process).
 Also, VEDA is open source so some users may wish to make custom modifications
\end_layout

The following is an instruction on how to install and use VEDA on your local
 machine.

Installing Rappture on your machine
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Step 1) VEDA requires the Rappture libraries, which are designed for Intel
 x86 Linux (and 32bit PPC or Intel Mac OS X).
 Therefore the full version VEDA will only run on Linux or MacOS and cannot
 be run on Windows.
 Some limited functionality is available on Windows, but it requires some
 extra effort.
 See Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 for details.
 The remainder of this chapter will focus on Linux or MacOS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Go to https://nanohub.org/infrastructure/rappture/wiki/Downloads and follow
 the provided installation instructions to install Rappture on your machine
 (recommend to use the binary distribution, only download the source code
 distribution if the binaries do not work for you).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Installing VEDA on your local machine: pre-compiled binaries
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once rappture is installed, now you can install VEDA.
 There are two options.
 The easy way is to use the pre-compiled binaries.
 These are provided for only for Intel x86 Linux.
 They are statically linked, so they should work with almost any Linux distribut
ion.
 If the pre-compiled binaries don't work, see the next section for compilation
 instructions.
 Follow these steps:

To run the GUIs, change to the rappture/ directory.
 Each tool has a separate sub-directory.
 Switch to the subdirectory of the tool you want to run (e.g.
 fzcurves) and run the command 'rappture' (assuming that the rappture binaries
 got added to your path in the previous step).
 Rappture will find the tool.xml file in that directory and load it.
 You can then enter your parameters exactly as on the website.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Alternatively, type 'rappture -tool FILENAME', where FILENAME is the complete

 g95 should probably work as well, but we will not guarantee it to work.
 Most linux distributions will have a gfortran package available (e.g.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

apt-get install gfortran
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) but if not download it from http://gcc.gnu.org/fortran/ .
 GNU make is also required.
 Also you'll need development versions of a few libraries if you don't typically
 compile programs on your machine (libstdc++6-4.3-dev, libexpat1-dev, zlib1g-dev)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2) Download the latest VEDA source code from https://nanohub.org/resources/adac
 (the download link is fairly small, and is hidden right under the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

launch tool
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 button).
 Uncompress the file to some convenient directory on your machine.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Alternatively, if you have subversion, you can check out the sources directly
 with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

svn checkout https://nanohub.org/tools/veda/svn/trunk veda
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (this will put the sources in a folder called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

veda
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 The advantage of this method is that you can quickly update when newer
 versions are released with just 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

svn update
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, instead of downloading and unzipping a file every time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3) Within the VEDA directory, change to the src/ directory and execute 'make
 F77=gfortran install
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 if using gfortran, or 'make F77=g95 install' if using g95, or just 'make
 install' if using Intel fortran.
 This will compile the binaries and install them in the bin/ directory.

Using VEDA on your local machine 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, let us introduce the concept of how VEDA interacts with the rappture
 libraries.
 The data flow as used on www.nanohub.org is like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1) The tool.xml specifies all GUI elements 2) rappture reads the tool.xml
 file, displays the GUI, takes your user input, and then generates a driver.xml
 file.
 driver.xml has the exact same structure as tool.xml, except that specific
 values are filled in for each parameter instead of the default values.
 3) The driver.xml file is then sent to the az_ddaskr executable.
 This program reads the the driver.xml, performs the actual computation,
 and then outputs a run.xml file.
 4) rappture reads the run.xml file and displays the data.
 This is illustrated graphically in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:dataflow"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can follow this process exactly on your local machine if you want.
 Simply change directories to the directory that contains the tool you want
 and type 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rappture
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The GUI will automatically come up and display that tool.
 Note that the directories all have abbreviated names.
 The tools associated with each directory are listed in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But you have more options.
 For example, you can
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A) Save the run.xml file and view it later.
 If you do multiple runs, you'll notice that a bunch of files will be created
 with names like run1271692464.xml.
 You can pick out the ones you want, rename them to something more memorable,
 (e.g.
 run-carbonnanotube1.xml) and move to another directory if you want.
 Then to see the file later, using rappture's rerun comment (e.g.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rerun run-carbonnanotube1.xml
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 This just lets you view the data, you can't use it as a starting point
 for future simulations.
 That is, if you press Input to go back to the parameters list, and type
 in some new parameters, and then hit Simulate, it still only shows the
 original computation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note: the rappture version rappture-Linux-i686-20081010 had a couple of
 significant bugs in the rerun program.
 Make sure that you use rappture-Linux-i686-20091009.tar.gz or later
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
B) Save the driver.xml file and use it as a starting point for future simulations.
 Normally rappture deletes the driver.xml files after the simulation is finished.
 There are three options to get a driver file.
 First, if you hit 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Abort
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 while a simulation is running, rappture won't delete the driver file.
 Look in the directory for a file named something like driver14516.xml.
 You can later restart that simulation using 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rappture -tool driver14516.xml
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Second, you can take an existing driver.xml file and edit it in a text editor
 (replace the values between the 
\begin_inset Formula $<$
\end_inset

current
\begin_inset Formula $><$
\end_inset

/current
\begin_inset Formula $>$
\end_inset

 tags) Finally, there is a little script that will create a driver file
 from a run file.
 It is in the VEDA src directory and the usage is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

run_to_driver.pl 
\begin_inset Formula $<$
\end_inset

 run1271692464.xml 
\begin_inset Formula $>$
\end_inset

 driver1.xml
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (you need to have Perl installed for this).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
C) View the results without using the rappture GUI.
 The run.xml is, as the name implies, an XML file, so any standard XML parser
 can read the data file.
 Example matlab scripts are provided in the bin/ directory (you will need
 the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sed
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 package installed for this script).
 You could come up with a similar program for Java or C++ or what have you.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
D) Once you have a driver file that has the parameters you like, you don't
 actually need the GUI anymore.
 For example, if you have a file driver1.xml, you can run 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

az_ddaskr driver1.xml
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and it will run the computation and generate a run file.
 You can later view the run file with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rerun
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 if you wish.

Running batch simulation / parameter studies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Running batch simulations is one option that is available when you run VEDA
 on your local machine that is not available on the nanohub website.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Running multiple jobs in serial on a single machine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The file param-explore.pl in the bin/ directory automates the process of
 generating and running multiple jobs.
 (you need to have Perl installed for this to work).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It starts from a template file you provide, and then generates and runs
 them one at a time as illustrated in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:dataflow_batch"

\end_inset

.
 This is suitable for running multiple jobs on a single machine one at a
 time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You will need to generate two files.
 The first is the runs file.
 This should be a text file with each line containing the full parameter
 set for one run.
 Each line should be a comma separated list of parameter=value.
 For example, to make 4 runs with different values of two parameters you
 might use this file:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
PARAM_E = 100, PARAM_nu = 10
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
PARAM_E = 100, PARAM_nu = 100
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
PARAM_E = 10, PARAM_nu = 10
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
PARAM_E = 10, PARAM_nu = 100
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The names of the parameters are completely arbitrary.
 They can be any name you want.
 The use of the prefix PARAM is not necessary, but recommended to make it
 easy to recognize what is a parameter in your template file.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second file that you need is the template file is an xml driver file
 except that some of the inputs have been replaced by tags.
 For example, there is a line in the driver file that normally looks something
 like this
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
<number id="Etip">
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
<about>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
<label> Young's modulus of tip (GPa)</label> 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
</description> </about> 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
<default>130</default> 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
<current>90</current> 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
</number>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You want to edit this file and replace the number inside the <current> line
 with your tag from the runs file.
 For example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
<number id="Etip">
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
<about>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
<label> Young's modulus of tip (GPa)</label> 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
</description> </about> 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
<default>130</default> 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
<current>PARAM_E</current> 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
</number>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the param-explore.pl file goes through the runs, it will replace PARAM_E
 in this file with the values that you have given it in the runs file.
 Note, this is a literal text substitution.
 Make sure that the tag names you pick don't occur anywhere else in the
 file.
 E.g.
 If you pick something like 'o' for your parameter instead of 'PARAM_E',
 the param-explore.pl would replace every 'o' with a number, e.g.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
<number id="Etip">
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
<ab100ut>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
<label> Y100ung's m100dulus 100f tip (GPa)</label> 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
</description> </ab100ut> 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
<default>130</default> 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
<current>100</current> 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
</number>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
which is probably not what you want.
 Hence the suggestion to use a unique prefix like PARAM_.
 Also, the script will do simple math on any line where a replacement is
 made.
 e.g.
 if TAG_Z=10, then <current>TAG_Z + 10</current> would be replaced with
 <current>20</current>.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once you have these two files, just type
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
param-explore.pl runs.txt template.xml ~/bin/az_ddaskr
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
replacing 'runs.txt' with the name of your runs file, template.xml with the
 name of your template file, and replacing ~/bin/az_ddaskr with the pathname
 of where you installed the VEDA executable.
 This will then run all of the files, and generate sequentially numbered
 output files: output1.out, output2.out, output3.out, etc.
 Once they have all been generated, you can post-process them using the
 GUI (e.g.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rerun output*
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

), or by reading them into matlab (use the rappture_reader_multi.m matlab
 script in the bin/ directory).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Running multiple jobs in parallel on several machines
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For multiple machines in parallel, follow the instructions above, with one
 exception.
 We want to generate all of the driver.xml files on one machine, but we don't
 want to run yet.
 Therefore, in the param-explore.pl script, instead of the VEDA executable,
 give it a dummy executable.
 For example
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
param-explore.pl runs.txt template.xml touch
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
param-explore will then generate all of the driver.xml files, but not actually
 run them.
 You can then use any standard batch system (e.g.
 Condor from http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/) to execute VEDA on the resulting
 driver.xml files.
 VEDA is statically linked against the rappture libraries, so you need only
 copy the az_ddaskr file to the compute nodes, you do not need to install
 rappture on them.

Compiling the rappture libraries on Windows
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have successfully compiled rappture on windows using the Cygwin package.
 It may be possible to use other compilers, but we have not tried them.
 Below is how we did it (note that these instructions are written assuming
 some knowledge of how to compile programs)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Install Cygwin from www.cygwin.com
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In addition to the basic install, select the following packages: binutils,
 expat, libexpat-devel, gcc-core, gcc-fortran, gcc-g++, libncurses-devel,
 make, time, zlib-devel (the installer will automatically select any dependencie
s).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Download the latest source code from https://nanohub.org/infrastructure/rappture/
wiki/Downloads (get just the rappture-src package, we have not yet tested
 the rappture-runtime package).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Ignore the compilation instructions on the rappture web page.
 we won't be building the full package, just the libraries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
open a cygwin bash shell window and change to the directory where you downloaded
 the rappture archive.
 Unzip it and change into to the directory
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
you'll need to make a few hacks to the 'configure' script.
 Specifically, replace the line 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

#define HAVE_GETTIMEOFDAY 1
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

#undef HAVE_GETTIMEOFDAY
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Then execute the following commands:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We recommend you install the cygwin 'gcc-fortran' package, which installs
 gfortran.
 We are not able to get g95 compiler to work with cygwin.
 The Intel fortran compiler has not yet been tested on cygwin.

Using VEDA on Windows

\begin_layout Standard
Using VEDA on Windows follows most of the general principles for running
 it on Linux, as described in sectiosn

 and

.
 The difference is that the GUI is not available to you.
 Therefore, you'll need to make three changes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
As described above, normally the rappture GUI takes a tool.xml file and generates
 a driver.xml.
 Since the GUI is not available, you will need to do this yourself.
 Use the tool_to_driver.pl file found in the bin/ directory.
 (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tool_to_driver.pl < tool.xml > driver.xml
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This will generate a driver file will all of the parameters set to their
 default value.
 You will need Perl installed to make this work (can be installed from www.perl.or
g)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
To change values from their defaults, you will need to hand edit the driver.xml
 file.
 If you are familar with the GUI layout of the tools, it should be easy
 to locate the various settings within the driver.xml file by searching for
 key words.
 You will want to edit the values in the <current> tags (not the <default>
 tag).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
You will not be able to use the GUI to post-process your results.
 We recommend reading the values into matlab using the rappture_reader_single.m
 file located in the bin/ directory.
