For bimodal, the simulation is carried out to the common period of the drive cycles. Therefore, the precision of the omega2/omega1
ratio has a direct influence on the simulation time.  E.g. 6.0 is fastest, 6.5 is slower (6.5:1 = 13:2), 6.25 is
even slower (6.25:1 = 25:4), and 6.249 is very slow.  For best performance, round omega2/omega1 to the ratio of two integers p/q,
such that q is small (10 or less recommended)
