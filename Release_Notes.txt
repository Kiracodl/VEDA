2.1.0
First version to be published at the new "veda" url instead of "adac"

2.0.26
First version published since the 2012 RSI article
added matlab gui to fit prony series
add option for fft on time history outputs
ability to plot force vs gap for time hist
allow turning off obs defl in time hist
added direct output (i.e. interferometer).  
added anti-aliasing to f-z curves output

2.0.24
bug fixes for linear contact viscoelasiticty

2.0.23
added magnetic dipole-dipole interactions

2.0.22
Major overhaul of viscoelasticity code
Bug fix: solvation shell properties can now be specified separately for substrate and feature
Bug fix: Ancyzkowski formula output now works correct when driving off resonance

2.0.21
added self-excitation for tapping mode 
minor bug fixes (calculation of base sample work, approach to setpoint in freq sweep, acoustic mode in FM)

2.0.20
added AC bias for electrostatic

2.0.19
Published FM Scanning tool
added AC bias for electrostatic

2.0.18
- added anti-aliasing filters for controller outputs

2.0.14
- fixed bug in lock-in time constant calculation
- added approach/retract for AM approach curves
- many manual updates and example updates

version 2.0.8:
fixed a bug in retraction curves

version 2.0.7:

Version 2.0.6:
-Sample engagement is now much more robust for AM Scanning.  
-Added option to plot sample engagement transients for advanced AM Scanning

Version 2.0.5
-Higher harmonics can now specified as reals instead of integers
-Controllers (Z, and FM) are now proper PI controllers
-Controller gains are not normalized by sampling frequency (was a bad hack for the old controller)
-Time history plots are now much quicker
-Energy propagation plots now include drive input energy and fluid damping energy (not available for acoustic mode).
-Minimum allowable amplitude is now 0.01 nm

Version 2.0.4
- Bugfix: acoustic drive forcing amplitude was incorrect for tip mass > 0
- New feature: VEDA now simulates an actual lock-in amplifier in addition to the fourier sine and
cosine integrals.  All feedback control is now based on lock-in amplifiers.
- New tools: force viewer tool, FM approach curves
- Manual has been significantly re-organized
- The majority of the examples in the manual have been programmed into the tools.  You 
can now run most manual examples in two clicks.  
- VEDA is now open source under the Q Public License

Version 2.0.3
- Bugfix: acoustic mode forcing phase was incorrect for tip mass > 0

Version 2.0.2, 2.0.1, 2.0.0
- no release notes
